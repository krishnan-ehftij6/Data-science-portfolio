Istanbul,Not Verified |  Ridiculous prices on everything. Tired staff. Will avoid or bring my own food and drink in the future. Tax free more expensive than with taxes for many things. Perfume store without any spray deodorant for men. Generic design. Too bad as flight with Turkish was good.,2,Arrival and Departure,February 2025,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,2,1,3,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  The biggest trap for the tourists worldwide, one Big Mac 25 euros and a bag of pistachio 76 euros. Staff doesn't speak English, there is not Duty Free Shops. The airport is chaotic and be prepared to walk kilometers. Free wifi is complicated and you cannot access, except if you will scan your passport.",1,Departure Only,February 2025,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |   Fast food price is just ridiculously expensive! Went to a fried chicken restaurant only to find out that their price has gone way too much for an average traveller. I checked other restaurants and snack bars to compare prices and their prices have increased. How can customers enjoy the airport when they are prevented from spending due to prohibitive prices? I missed the Old Istanbul Airport when the airport was more inclusive rather exclusionary than what I experienced. My partner also transited here and was surprised that there was no pharmacy inside the transit terminal. Although I love flying with Turkish Airlines, I will probably not do it for a long time as Istanbul Airport has been a rip-off for me.",2,Transit,January 2025,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,5,5,1,1,5,3
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |   This airport is luxury and new! However, there are multiple issues that needs to be addressed. The number of toilets for such a busy airport is ridiculously low and more importantly very very dirty! I couldn’t find any clean cabin during my visit which was very disgusting!  The airport staff is somehow very unhappy and angry. Staff should be kind and accommodating. The prices are also very expensive compared to other international airports. I feel that this airport doesn’t represent Turkey well.",2,Arrival and Departure,January 2025,Business,Arrival and Departure,1,2,3,3,4,2,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Arrived just before midnight with TA from KRK and was surprised with a 5hrs delay of my flight to Hong Kong. The airport facilities are subpar in comparison to Zurich or even Helsinki which I could have chosen as alternative transit for the same journey. So called ""nap zone"" is far from comfortable when you're drilling the walls past midnight. No matter how many dining and shopping options provided, you can't call it a world-class airport if they don't get the basics right for such circumstances, that is a comfortable lounge with reclined chairs. It's all utterly useless and irrelevant to a passenger who transiting at midnight and expecting to spend a whole night at the airport when they are drilling the walls around past midnight. Signages are confusing. Flight status boards displayed in local language only?? Not the way to go Turkiye.",3,Transit,December 2024,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,1,2,0,N/A,3,N/A
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Be prepared to walk kilometers, in an unfriendly environment. Get ready to pay a fortune for a bottle of water or an orange juice. Get ready to cross endless commercial zones looking like Las Vegas. Free wifi lasts only for one hour. Horrible experience. And this is a new airport! Whfy didn't the fire the architects immediately?",1,Transit,November 2024,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,3,1,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  Beautiful new architecture doesn’t make up for an airport’s miserable customer service. Upon arrival security officers shooed me away from several busy passport control areas before I found one where I could get in line after a very long walk. Lufthansa lost my bag. Dealing with Celebri, their baggage handler, was a dragged out, exhausting ordeal. I had no communication from them after making lost bag claim for more than 48 hours. Phones were not answered and calls not returned after leaving messages three times. Bag was finally located four days later, when I had boarded ship for Viking cruise but was still in port. The Lufthansa baggage service, Celebri, refused to deliver my bag to cruise ship at the port or release it to Viking representative at airport. Celebri made me return to airport in person to claim my bag. The airport is a LONG ride from town. Celebri is hidden in a secure area and can only be reached by a telephone by an unmanned information kiosk. Celebri employee who answered phone said she was eating lunch and would come out to help me in ten minutes. Multiple other travelers showed up, called Celebri and were given various snarky answers as to when a representative would come out to help us. It was more than 30 minutes later when a surly young man came out and guided us back to the secure area. The only answer I was given for why I had to claim my bag in person was “Customs.” After four days without my suitcase, being forced to retrieve it in person at the airport was an abusive four hour descent into a hell of rude, indifferent Celebri employees in an airport that is already not passenger friendly. They didn’t just ruin my day, they ruined my vacation by treating me like garbage. I strongly advise NOT checking a bag if you are flying to Istanbul.",1,Arrival Only,November 2024,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,3,3,1,0,4,N/A,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |   I travel a lot and used IST frequently, mainly for transfer flights. Now I will choose other routes. Why?  You need an average 20 minutes of walking between the gates, if you not happy 30 minutes and more.  You have to consider a minimum of 2 hours transfer time (walking time to the transfer desk, security check, walking time to your gate). Short international transfer doesn't work at all.  The staff doesn’t speak english, they are not supportive at all.  Prices of everything are abnormal high. While I was waiting on n the cue of the security check they closed 50% - with hundreds of passengers in the cue. The result: You are extremely stressed. I catched my connection flight on last minutes after running through the airport. An experience I will not repeat at all!",1,Arrival and Departure,November 2024,Business,Arrival and Departure,4,1,5,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |   Istanbul Airport is one of the worst airports you could ever visit. It is constantly under construction with people just hammering away, and it is just a terrible place to be. First, you can get free internet but you need to feed your passport details to a kiosk, which prints out a code you can use to connect for free for 1 hour only. 1 hour. At other airports it is free for unlimited use and you just need to connect to the wifi. Why the extra hassle for 1 hour? And if you connect to the internet, remember to use a VPN. I made the mistake of not doing this and soon I kept getting Blockchain phone calls. I knew it was the airport because of my unique name and how I use it daily, so I knew it was the airport. Your data is at risk if you connect to their wifi. And then we get to the insane pricing at the vending machines. Airports are expensive for sure, but a can of Fanta cost from a machine 450 TRY. That’s $13! £10! For a can of drink! Insanity! Oh, you want to go to Lost and Found for an airline to pick up something you forgot in a plane? It is in the arrivals area, so if you’re only transiting you still have to make your way through security and passport control, go to the baggage pick ip where the airline Lost and Found is, wait while they tell you “oh sorry you had to email us who was going to pick up the item so we can’t give it to you”, then having to get back through passport control and security again empty handed to catch your connecting flight. Genius. The one thing that is sorta okay is the Yotel hotel for long layovers you can sleep in airside. However, it is expensive at around $300 a room for a night, but they know you have no choice if you want to sleep so you have to take it. If you need to travel and can connect at a different airport, just choose a different place. Anywhere but this one.",1,Transit,October 2024,Family Leisure,Transit,3,1,1,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | We are a family of 3 with a severe low functioning child with epilepsy, hearing and vision impairment. We landed in IST with a short connection time. Airport assistance met us at the gate, and we told them we needed to get to our connection as soon as possible. They said they could use their powered wheelchair to transport my son and there was a buggy at the gate as well, but the buggy driver refused to transport the manual (not battery-powered) wheelchair even though we could fold it up. I ended up going on the buggy with our luggage and my husband ran and pushed my son in his wheelchair from terminal F to terminal B. The buggy driver even had the audacity to ask for a tip after dropping me off at the gate while my husband was still making his way to the gate. My husband and son made it to the gate in time for boarding but left us a bad impression of the airport service. On the return flight, we landed in IST for a 7-hour layover before our flight to ORD. An assistant met us at the bridge and, using our son's wheelchair, brought us to the IGA lounge as we requested and set up a time to bring us to the gate when it was time to board. Assistant came and brought us to the gate, he went to get the aisle chair, left it by the gate and told us that someone else would come and help us with the boarding. But when it came time for boarding, no one came to get us in line to board. There were two other assistants with powered wheelchairs in line helping their passenger board. We asked one of them if someone was coming to help us, she said to wait, someone will come. Then boarding started and the two assisted their assigned passengers on board then business class passengers started boarding. We were still left on the side even as economy class began boarding. The assistants came back out and we tried to get them to assist us, but they refused, saying that someone else is coming. We asked the check-in staff for help, and they refused to do anything saying someone will come and continued to board the rest of the economy class passengers up until the last few passengers. The boarding supervisor did not treat us with respect and kept putting us aside with lip service that someone will come and get us boarded with the aisle chair. Even when most of the passengers boarded, we were still left at the gate and the two assistants were just standing around doing nothing. We insisted on boarding ourselves but were prevented from doing so. In the end, the two assistants reluctantly assisted us through. Even when we requested help with our hand-carry bags to the plane, the check-in staff refused to help saying it's not their job. We were already stressed out with our son's damaged wheelchair, lack of sleep, and increasingly agitated son from waiting so long to board. We ended up boarding last with almost all passengers already seated. During this whole time our son was feeling discomfort and agitated from the long wait, ending up wetting and soiling his pants by the time he got to his seat. I broke down in tears seeing my son suffer, upset and uncomfortable, we were exhausted from half a day of travel, and felt abandoned at the gate without being able to pre-board and settle our son for the long flight ahead. We are truly disappointed and dissatisfied with the service at IST as well as the treatment we received from the check-in staff at IST. Our actual experience doesn't reflect the kind of service we expect based airline ratings.",1,Transit,October 2024,Family Leisure,Transit,4,3,5,3,N/A,3,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Two things strike the traveller about the ""new"" Istanbul Airport, firstly it is huge and secondly it is eye wateringly expensive! Its single terminal building means you can walk everywhere but there are some very long stretches with no travelators. Departure Gates are shown 2 hours before the flight and there are no announcements so you have to watch the screens for information. Some transit passengers have to go through security scanning depending upon the origin of the flight - this is OK but even with brand new scanners that should accept liquids you have to remove them for separate scanning which can slow things down. The overriding feeling is that EVERYTHING is overpriced. Can you justify spending EUR8.00 on a Pan-Au-Chocolat or GBP22.00 on a McDonalds meal? The range of high end goods available in the shops is amazing but again the prices are not ""duty free"" or ""tax free"" but - how much can they get away with! The net result is a lot of people wandering around but not a lot of buying taking place. There is very limited seating in the main areas, except if you have bought food. Good seating at the gates and reasonable boarding processes. Only 1 hour of free Wi-Fi after you register your passport details available so use it wisely!",6,Transit,November 2024,Couple Leisure,Transit,4,1,4,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified | The airport looks big, clean and good safety control. The prices of the food are extremely high. Eight euro for a simple cookie. 13 euro for a sandwich - Crazy.",4,Arrival and Departure,November 2024,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,3,3,1,1,1,3
Istanbul,"Not Verified | I was staying here for a 6 hour layover, my father is paralyzed on his right side so once we arrived to the airport there had been a request for a wheelchair when I booked our tickets. The guy came with a wheelchair and was extremely impatient, he seemed like he had something more important to do. He requested the boarding pass which was in my backpack, I told him to give me a second and I’ll get it for him which then he got extremely aggressive with me, if it were someone else in my shoes and were not as patient as me the situation would’ve escalated very quickly. There was an issue getting him to the handicap area since they’d rather take more than 1 people at once with a car thing. Every one of those handicap transporter were extremely rude and condescending. The airport was extremely messy, there weren’t enough seats either. The pricing was extremely high priced, I understand that most airports are like this but this airport was much more expensive than any other airport. The airport is huge but not in a good way. It felt huge but it was empty at the same time, whoever did the designs for the airport did a great job to make people feel uncomfortable, you will also have to walk for miles just to get to your gate.",1,Arrival and Departure,October 2024,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1,1,2,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified | I give this the Worst airport ever. Duty free more expensive then Champs Elysees Paris,  the food 3 times expensive then any airport in Europe!

Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified |   Unacceptable long waiting time to get through passport control and security check it took almost an hour. Extremely expensive food of a mediocre quality,2,Departure Only,October 2024,Family Leisure,Departure Only,4,3,5,1,5,N/A,3
Istanbul,"Not Verified | Istanbul Airport is without doubt the worst and least friendly airport I have ever transited. My wife and I were Business Class back to Heathrow. On check in we were given no directions to the fast track lane and there was no signage, to the point it can't exist. It took us a full 90 minutes to transit passport and security (my wife struggles when standing for long periods) Having passed security (very curt) we walked some distance to the BA allocated Business Lounge, only to find queues to get in and no room to site down when we did. There was little time left as the gate was called open, so grabbing two bottles of water we walked the full distance to our gate, to find two staff and no plane. We found somewhere to sit until the board changed to boarding (although entitled to the business class lounge, the distance and packed lounge did not engender either of us with the desire or energy to return). As an International Airport which suggests it is the largest in Europe (this can only be by area, because there are certainly nowhere near the flight numbers to compete with the largest airports in Europe) it is very poor. If I was a Turkish Tax payer I would be asking serious questions as to why this white elephant is so large and they wan't it to be the largest in the World (Why). I will never transit this airport again.",1,Departure Only,September 2024,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,4,2,1,2,4,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |   One of the worst transfer experiences I’ve ever had. On landing, taxiing time was almost 1 hour. We had to walk for miles to reach first the transit controls, and then our gate. At transit controls our duty free purchases from the departure airport were challenged, and had to argue to keep them. The duty free was a total rip off, 8 pieces of fresh baklavas came at €35! Staff were unfriendly as extremely slow. Finally, the boarding process required our passport and boarding pass to be checked three times by three different agents, standing in a queue for another thirty minutes. Overall a surreal and extremely unpleasant experience.",2,Transit,September 2024,Couple Leisure,Transit,4,N/A,2,1,1,1,2
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Ground staff lacking respect, ignored when approach them for help, arrogant and very disorganised in dealing with transit passengers and passengers with assistance. I was a business class passenger who required wheel chair assistance and my husband was my carer but travelled in economy. It was noted that he needed assistance for travelling distance but was never given. I was put on the mobile buggy to reach connecting flight but the driver said my husband could not come with me and nor would he be picked up at all. I objected and he and I had verbal altercation and I was ordered off the buggy or he would not go anywhere with me and I would miss the flight. I was forced to get off and was kindly picked up by a wheelchair. I am 76 and use walking stick. My husband had to carry the walk on baggage fir me and himself. The driver wanted to plonk the carry on baggage on my lap. I cannot carry weight on my legs due to many spinal surgeries. Also I had tried to approach a staff member to ask a question and she totally ignored me and kept walking away from me. In another transit flight we taken off plane and were told to wait for train buggy to pick all the special assistance passengers. No one showed up and so we all ended up having to make our way to other end of airport to boarding gate as the plane was boarding. One official I asked on the way replied that he could not speak English. Eventually I approached an empty mover and he told us to hop on and took us to the gate just in time.",1,Transit,September 2024,Business,Transit,4,3,1,0,N/A,N/A,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | First time in the new big Istanbul airport so I was curious to see how it was. On the positive side everything looks nice and clean, and there are lots of shops. On the negative side, distances between gates may be really long and tiring. On the main body of the terminal there are no tapis roulant so you have to walk a lot. Beyond that, WiFi is only available after a complex registration process and limited to 1 hour! I could hardly believe this, since I've been into very small airports in Asia or Europe were Wi Fi is fully open and with no time limits. This looks like a jurassic service.",3,Departure Only,August 2024,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,5,4,4,3,3,1,3
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | To return tax, I had to get to another desk and only one employee was serving to approximately 40 passengers. For Turkish airlines passengers there is no need to go to another desk, this is only for non-Turkish airlines passengers, which is a discrimination against passenger profile. I could not get my tax because I could not wait until my turn comes (I waited for more than an hour), otherwise I would have missed my flight. This is very bad customer service I had ever seen.",2,Departure Only,September 2024,Business,Departure Only,3,N/A,4,0,N/A,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service, very rude and charge you even if you don't have to pay the amount.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | The staff was incredibly unfriendly and unhelpful. Laughed at me when I asked for directions. Refused to give me food vouchers even though I had a 10 hour layover with connecting flight. That was when I was lucky enough to find staff, though. They don't have info desks, only these big orange video boxes that are supposed to help you find stuff, but in reality I found maybe one working in the whole airport. Even with a 10h layover I was unable to visit the city because I couldn't find anyone to ask directions to find out how to get to the shuttles, and the orange boxes were useless, and by the time 5h of my layover time had gone by I gave up trying to go out. The food is so expensive you want to cry just looking at the price tags (6€ for a single macaron??). So, difficult to get out, impossible to buy food (or anything else); at least you can relax and watch a movie, right? No, because you only get 1 hour of free WiFi. After which it's 6€ for an additional 2 hours. If you're going to deprive me of food and a visit to the city, the least you can do is leave me an internet connection. The queue for Security Check is ridiculously long for such a big (and supposedly ""the world's best"") airport. Most of the aisles are closed, and the check itself if very slow and old-fashioned. Staff will yell at you for following the signs that very clearly indicate to go in one direction or other (i.e. ""Security Check this way"" but then for some reason you're wrong if you go the way that's indicated, and are actually meant to completely disregard the signs and go somewhere else). Once again, I've never seen such rude and unhelpful staff. They showed no empathy whatsoever for people who had been denied boarding, and made no move to help them solve the situation, which is what they should be there for. Most of them also don't have very good command of English, which is a bit of a problem when they work at help desks because they need to deal with passengers from all over the world. Not impressed at all with this airport.",1,Transit,September 2024,Solo Leisure,Transit,1,4,1,1,N/A,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified |   The airport is made large, maybe to beat Dubai, but it doesn't benefit passengers. There are about 13 exits from the airport but when you come from metro (10mins far without reason for new construction), there's NO sign of entrance and you spend 10 mins to test the closed entrances (entrance no.10 is only open!) exit to metro also not straight, you have to walk a lot. Meals are extremely expensive. I've seen only one free water fountain near toilet of a distant terminal, and couldn't find it again next trip. There's one hot water point for Chinese tourists, which I couldn't find. Shops are too expensive.

Istanbul,Not Verified |  One of the worst airport with impolite airport personnel. None of them spoke English. The customer service was more interred in her makeup than helping the customer.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  After flying from Hanover, Germany, we had a layover at Atatürk Airport in Istanbul. My daughter fell ill with a fever, and we had to take her to the hospital. We ended up staying one night at the hospital and another night at a hotel. When my daughter felt better, I contacted the airport to retrieve our luggage. After completing the necessary procedures and collecting the luggage, I needed to return to our hotel. I hailed a taxi that was waiting for passengers outside the airport.  I gave the driver the hotel address since we couldn't communicate in English. Once inside the taxi, with my daughter on my lap, I noticed the driver had a camera and kept turning it towards me. When I asked him about it, he claimed that Turkish police require taxi drivers to have cameras. Suddenly, the driver stopped in an isolated area resembling a parking garage or loading dock. Alarmed, I questioned him, and he replied that he needed to drop off some goods. Fearing for our safety, I made an international call to my partner in Germany, explaining our location and situation, and asked him to call the police. I also threatened the driver, saying that the police were on their way. The driver, who appeared very threatening, started shouting but eventually agreed to drive us to the hotel. Ladies and girls, please take the following precautions when traveling alone: Get the driver's information: Note the taxi's number, driver's name, and any other identifying details. Stay connected: Keep your phone charged and stay in contact with someone who knows your whereabouts. Use official transportation: Whenever possible, use official airport transportation services or pre-booked rides. By sharing my experience, I hope to help others avoid similar situations.

Istanbul,"Not Verified |   On 5/23/24 I flew into Istanbul airport and arrived with one hour to make my connecting flight. Airport personnel indicated i had to go through passport screening, which I did. I was then struggling to find the gate for departure but was told I had to go through screening again, which I did, along with another baggage scan. This delayed me and I missed my flight. Directions for making connecting flights are now clear. Turkish airways initially blamed me for missing my flight, then put me up at a hotel. Subsequent to that I waited 50 minutes in a ""non-turkish-citizen"" line for a PP screening. When I got to a representative, she told me I have to go to ""passport control 1 line"". I went to PP control 1 line and a sign said it was closed and referred me back to the line I was just in. I managed to get by the closed sign and waited another 50 minutes. During this wait PP control staff let several customers in ahead of me, delaying me further. In total I went through PP control six times on 5/23/24. Is this really necessary? On 5/24/24, I came to the airport 2 hours early. Had my baggage screened three times, and had to produce my passport for inspection three times as well. the last two inspections were less than 15 yards apart. Is all this really necessary? How many times should a tourist expect to be screened in Istanbul airport? 3-6 times? Good to know for future travel. Inspection staff were not helpful as well.",1,Transit,May 2024,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,3,1,2,3,1,1

Was going to use the Priority Pass Lounge but the queue was too long and so i could not be bothered waiting in the long line.

Make sure you dont catch a taxi unless accompanied by a Turkish speaking guide. You will be ripped off. The international airport is quite clean and reasonably well organised.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Massive airport without adequate ergonomy. Turkish airlines will taxi around the airport for 20 to 25 min getting to a gate, to then dump passengers in the middle of the tarmac. Once stopped we waited for a bus for another 15 min and disembarking took another 10 minutes. The buses were packed. Finally made it to an exit after another 15 minutes of driving. It took us just under an hour to move to the airport after landing. Then another 20 min walk to the transit section, speedy security another 10 min, followed by another 15 min walk to the departing gate. We made our flight only because the incoming was delayed. The above explain the electric centaurs zooming around with people, and the airport shuttle that are driving in the middle of the crowd. Prepare some good running shoes and plenty of time to transit. I wonder how this airport expects to expend even further. Good luck.",5,Arrival and Departure,May 2024,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,3,3,4,4,N/A,4
Istanbul,Not Verified |   Absolute rip off. The basic food and drink prices in Istanbul Airport are extortionate. One hour free WiFi too? Then you get scammed for anything after that!

Istanbul,"Not Verified |   I recently traveled through Istanbul Airport, and my experience was disappointing. One major drawback was the exorbitant prices for food, drinks, and shopping items. A simple coffee or sandwich set me back significantly more than expected, and even basic necessities in the retail shops were overpriced, making it hard to justify any purchases. Additionally, the airport seemed chaotic and overcrowded, with many passengers stranded and resorting to sleeping on the floors due to delayed or canceled flights. This led to a disorganized atmosphere, with people sprawled out across waiting areas, making navigation difficult. Overall, my time at Istanbul Airport was far from pleasant, and I hope to see improvements in the future.",2,Arrival and Departure,January 2024,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,1,4,1,1,2,4
Istanbul,"Not Verified |   The airport is beautiful but its a big mess. The staff doesn't know English well and always guides you to the wrong place. In my case, the connecting flight was displayed and when i reached to the gate after walking for 30 minutes with my kids, they changed it again and then it was in the extreme opposite direction which means another 30-40 minutes walk. How can you expect someone to run to catch his flight with the kids for such a long distance? The signage is very good and helpful. Food area is also good and provide a good selection of food to the travelers.",3,Arrival and Departure,January 2024,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,1,5,3,5,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Any airport that does not offer unlimited free wifi from my perspective, is not serving its passengers. Passengers can only get 1 hour free wifi by scanning their passport. Prices at the airport are higher than they need to be. Ground transportation is a bit of a mess with congestion and confusion. The airport is grand in design with a lot of wasted space - must be expensive to heat and cool? This airport like many new airports feels more like a shopping mall than a hub for air travel",3,Arrival and Departure,April 2024,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,2,3,2,2,1,2
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul Airport has big ambitions but is far from the standards found at the best airports in the world. Although the building is spacious and open, passport control was fairly efficient with several gates to pass through, and bathroom facilities were modern and clean, these positives do not outweigh the many negatives. Firstly, food and drinks are extraordinarily expensive: 15 euros for a small beer, 40 euros for a kebab, 20 euros for a menu at McDonalds. For comparison, even in the most touristic areas of Istanbul, a large beer would typically cost about a third of that and would not come in a plastic cup. It just leaves you with a bitter taste of the airport seeing its visitors as walking wallets. The same vibe comes from the types of shops that occupy a large part of the airport. Maybe people willing to pay 50 euros for a simple airport meal are looking for a Louis Vuitton bag, but from the empty shops it seems that this audience is very limited. There is a huge Duty Free section, but they all sell exactly the same products. Secondly, WiFi is restricted and requires you to swipe your passport through a machine. Not only do you have no idea what is happening with that information (and why do they need my passport information in the first place?), it also just gives you one hour access. Not a standard that modern-day airports should have. Thirdly, boarding was chaotic despite our airline using boarding zones, but the gate crew did not care and just let everyone board at the same time. I would have been annoyed if I had paid for a ticket with priority boarding. Lastly, we used this airport for a city trip to Istanbul, but the airport is 40 kilometers away from the city center. That would not be such an issue if there was a simple public transport connection, but taking the metro requires you to change 4-5 times to reach downtown Istanbul, and the airport busses take 1.5 hours to reach a metro station on the outskirts of the city center. Luckily there are plenty of taxis around, but they come with a high chance of being scammed (our driver on the way back tried to make us pay twice). All in all, not the best experience.",3,Arrival and Departure,April 2024,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,2,4,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Spectacular airport with very poor services and extremely expensive prices. It makes no sense to be a transit Airport and give only 1 hour free Wifi, to have to pay for luggage cart, and that the cheapest menu like McDonald's is 20€ or even more. One soft drink or water is 6€. Worse experience than in Dubai, Doha, Madrid, Paris.  Really It makes no sense.",2,Transit,March 2024,Couple Leisure,Transit,5,2,3,1,1,1,4
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Firstly, this airport is big and has concourses from A to F. To get from one concourse to the other, you are required to get to a central main area. I arrived at concourse F and my next flight was from concourse B. With what might seem as a reasonable connection time, at this airport, you have to have more. There are no buses, monorails, or modes of transport from one concourse to the other. Distances are vast and it is always crowded. If you are anything thing but a fit youngster, you are in for a anxious and stressful trek after a long flight. Remember that gates close 15 minutes before departure. Now, there are these youngsters on Segways with a seat that can transport you from one gate to the other. It blew my mind that they charge US$20 for that service. There are golf carts that can take you around but they are so few given the immense distance to be covered. I wonder how many people miss their connections. One other thing that I noted was that the airport staff including those at the transfer and help desks are poor English speakers and get defensive and rude when they cannot communicate coherently. At the gates, boarding is chaotic. If you are boarding a flight to the US, the additional screening of in cabin luggage and of the person is a sham. 4-5 people are packed to small table and are asked to lay all your in cabin luggage, empty all your pockets, watches, belts, wallet, etc. There is absolutely no room and I saw people trying to sort out their cell phone from their neighbors belongings. All the while the people who are supposed to be screening are literally shouting and herding passengers through. So much for security screening. Everything at this airport is expensive. Consider that the country's inflation stands at above 60%. If you are connecting through this airport, give yourself plenty of time. There are enough distractions to lure you to shop as the airport is one big shopping mall. Stay focused or you will miss your flight. And, the ground staff are not easy to communicate with. Good luck.",2,Arrival and Departure,March 2024,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,2,2,0,5,N/A,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had one of the worst experience with Turkish Airlines at the connecting airport. No one was there to guide us further, they closed the door early.

Overall a very poor experience.",2,Transit,March 2024,Family Leisure,Transit,2,1,1,3,3,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified | Limited number of seating areas. If Istanbul airport wanted to become hub for transitory passengers it has to provide adequate resting place for transitory passengers. So they can have adequate water fountains, sitting areas and mobile charging points for their layovers. After a long flight no passenger likes to sit on the floor so airport staff shouldn't be rude to such passengers instead should rightly direct them to empty seating areas.",5,Transit,March 2024,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,1,5,3,4,2,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  A superficially impressive airport with more high end shops then anyone could possibly need. But some serious irritations. Transit was slow and cumbersome; WiFi provision was shocking - both the stingy 1 hour allocation and mechanism to activate it, plus the speed once finally confirmed. The food prices were absolutely extortionate, especially given the state of the Turkish economy. It’s as of they are trying to retrospectively fund the airport by seriously overcharging. Will avoid in future.",2,Transit,March 2024,Business,Transit,3,2,3,2,2,1,2

For example a noodle box with drink cost you 750 TL or 21 EURO. The cheapest McD meals is 18 EURO. That’s ridiculous. Also, very stingy airport with only 1 hour free WIFI. And you have to register your passport in the kiosk to have the password for the WiFi. Sometimes, the machine cannot read your passport so you have to do it over and over again. Never ever I experience something ridiculous like this in my entire life. Pay for WiFi in the airport? And you claimed to be a 5-star airport?

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I had a horrible experience at Istanbul Airport on February 25. I was there on a layover from Cairo to Seattle. The connecting flight gate was about 1,700 meters away from the arrival gate and we were short on time. Because my son needed a wheelchair, the wheelchair person said my husband and I could head to the gate and he would bring my son ""fast."" We ran to the gate to make sure he would not wait long for us. When we arrived, my son wasn't there and the Turkish Airlines representatives had no idea where he was. They said the company that operates the wheelchair is independent. Running around trying to find an information desk or any airport staff who could help, there was nothing. All of that while the airline was announcing ""last call"" for our flight. I eventually found a random wheelchair person who told me that there is a desk near Gate A2 that could help. Nope. The two people at the desk who barely spoke English had no idea, and arrogantly requested me to go back to the gate. Back at the gate, I asked to speak with airport security, they said there was no airport security except past passport control! After everyone else had boarded, and still the airline staff had no idea where my son was, he eventually showed up TERRIFIED with a group of people in a cart. It turned out they moved him from a wheelchair to a cart and made several stops to pick others. We barely made the flight. I will never fly via Istanbul again.",1,Transit,February 2024,Family Leisure,Transit,3,N/A,1,0,N/A,N/A,1

We were carrying a lot of bags and I was carrying them alone and my wife was carrying the baby. When I put all the bags on the scanner machine, the security man allowed only my wife and the baby to pass and asked my to “Stop!” I told him that this is my family. How will my wife unload the bags from the scanner machine? He does not answer me and does not allow me to pass! Until my wife had to put the baby girl on the floor to unload the bags while I was watching my baby girl on the floor who could barely sit because she is only 8 months old and she might fall on her head!! All this was in front of my eyes and I was screaming and saying, “My child, let me pass!” There is no response. Then the security man allowed me to pass, but he told me to stop aside and test me for drugs test. What chaos and madness. The worst experiences in my life were at this ridiculous airport.

Istanbul,"Not Verified |  I booked a flight for my unaccompanied 58-year-old mother, who is not tech-savvy and doesn't speak Turkish. Despite arriving at the airport over 3 hours early for her flight, the check-in counter opened just 2 hours before the flight. The officer denied her a printed boarding pass even when he was repeatedly asked to provide her with it, he stated that the E-Boarding pass on her phone (obtained through online check-in with no/old gate number) was enough. Despite witnessing her situation, he didn't arrange for or offer any special assistance. When she reached the gate mentioned on her E-Boarding pass that she was directed towards, she found out that the gate number for her flight had changed without any notice. After a lot of struggle and reaching the correct gate, she found that the flight had departed. She was left stranded at the airport for approximately 5 hours with no support. She was alone and kept asking for help inside, but nobody understood or helped her willingly, and any airline or airport staff she approached was not able to assist her or guide her, they kept on saying they had no information. There were no passenger calls made in her name that could reach her. And as a result, she ended up missing the flight. Despite explaining the entire ordeal, the airline has refused to acknowledge their fault or to reschedule the flight. This is utterly unjust.",1,Departure Only,February 2024,Family Leisure,Departure Only,4,3,1,3,3,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  I thought Istanbul Airport would have settled down by now since it was brand new when I flew first 5 years ago but it has not. This is a major huge international Airport that needs Customer Service booths 24 hours a day in multiple places to guide & help passengers. During the day there is still airport staff all over the place you can ask for help but God-forbid you land there at night needing to connect to another flight, you are all on your own in that 3-mile-long airport. There is no airport staff to be found anywhere to ask questions, its like a graveyard. They need to have luggage trolley stations all over the place but they do not. You have to find the far away location to get one & you do not know where that is. WiFi should be available to passengers immediately upon landing but its not. You have to go to special booths to register with 25 people waiting before you to get access. Not good. I landed there from LA later at night, had a 3-hour layover, got out of my gate, asked a couple of uniformed people right outside exiting my plane if they can look up my next flight gate number on their airport phones tablets, their reply is “I don’t know”! I cannot help you! (And, most of them don’t speak English). They pointed me to the big screens farther away to find it myself. They said “The gate number will be decided & posted on the board eventually before your flight”. You wait & wait & wait; no gate info shows up. And finally, when & if it does show up right before your flight, you are historically rushing & running with you carry on bags, exhausted from your previous flight to the next gate which is far far away. Mind you, this airport is like 8 football fields long & wide. Istanbul airport needs to install customer service booths in multiple spots at the airport to help passengers 24/7, people employed at the airport should be able to speak English fluently, should be able to look up on their airport tablet / airport phones & tell weary passengers what gate number they need to go & point them to the right direction.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Arrival: Clean airport and fast passport control. However it was difficult to navigate towards shuttles to the city and metro as not many signs are placed. Overall I'm satisfied with an arrival experience. Departure: Check-in and passport control are passed swiftly and without significant delays. While some security screening checkpoints are now providing an opportunity not to remove liquids and electronics from your luggage, some still require you to, and since you're being assigned a checkpoint by an officer in line, the need to separate liquids still exist and depends on a luck of a checkpoint being assigned to you. I find paid wifi (one hour free then at least 6 euros to continue) to be an off-putting decision that, considering high both food and beverages prices, is ridiculous and therefore feeling of being seen as a walking-wallet is rather disturbant. Toilets are clean and located almost everywhere which is a huge advantage for the airport considering its size. Agents near the gate seemed to mess up the boarding group sequences as well as departure time and therefore all passengers were standing in front of the gate for about half an hour. One of the agents was behaving unprofessionally as she was rude and blamed passengers for actions of other agent.

When we eventually found the Turkish airlines hotel desk after about an hour of searching the lady that spoke to us at the desk was very abrupt and rude. I tried speaking nicely to her but it was clear she wanted me to argue with her with the way she was talking to me I tried to be nicer every time she shouted at me but it was almost like being nicer was making more angry.

Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified |  You have to pay 6 euros for 2 hours wifi connection . Just 1 hour is free. They take advantage of tourists needs. Toilets are super dirty. Food choice is not enough,2,Arrival and Departure,September 2023,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1,3,3,1,3,1,2
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | In spite of being a relatively new airport, Istanbul Airport faces several issues. Firstly, after a long flight, it's quite disconcerting to discover that the air conditioners within the airport terminal aren't functioning efficiently. The indoor climate is neither adequately cool or properly dehumidified. Moreover, smoke tends to permeate from the smoking lounges, exacerbating the situation. This requires prompt resolution. The absence of adequate lighting in the area in front of passport control contributes to a gloomy ambiance inside the terminal. However, the airport's most significant challenge lies in cleanliness and maintenance. The accumulation of dust and grime on the glass surfaces, which appear to have been neglected since the construction phase, coupled with unpleasant odors in the restrooms, damaged mats, and damp floors, is unbecoming of an international terminal of this magnitude. Additionally, the presence of dirt and debris on the glass elevators in the parking area is highly off-putting. Furthermore, the haphazardly placed signboards for tourism companies in the arrivals reception hall, along with the excessive noise generated by the staff in proximity, evokes comparisons to provincial bus terminals. In conclusion, Istanbul Airport must prioritize significant efforts towards enhancing its cleanliness and maintenance practices to effectively compete with its counterparts in the Gulf.",5,Arrival and Departure,August 2023,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1,2,4,2,4,3,3
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airport I have been to, people are so rude. The facilities appeared to be outdated and not maintained well. The staff I interacted with were not particularly helpful or courteous, making the travel experience more stressful than it needed to be. I'd advise travelers to manage their expectations when passing through this airport.",1,Arrival and Departure,August 2023,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified | I travel through Istanbul airport every 5 weeks and I am absolutely disgusted with the service every time I travel. Every member of staff from the catering staff to the transfer desk and security are so rude and arrogant. At times they are even confrontational. It is obvious that there is a lack of training in all areas, especially customer service and people skills. Another of my complaints is that I cannot believe that they charge €9.50 for 24 hours WiFi or €6.50 for 2 hours. I travel to many different airports worldwide and am never charged for WiFi. Istanbul is the only airport that is. As I can observe, trying to maximise profits from passengers rather than have customer/passenger satisfaction. Also the prices of all services are extortionate. If I could travel through any other airport when commuting to work I would. It is a shame as I have spent many vacations in Turkey and very much like the country and people, but Istanbul airport in my honest opinion is the worst airport I have ever been to. I understand that my review will not change anything but do hope that in the future they will review all departments and facilities and realise that if they want to have the reputation that a number of airports have, they will have to implement changes.",1,Arrival and Departure,September 2023,Business,Arrival and Departure,2,1,3,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  If you have mobility issues, avoid Istanbul airport (IST) as plague I have travelled with my parents that both have mobility issues and the request for assistance was placed and approved long in advance. Upon arrival in Istanbul, we realised that there was only one person with a wheelchair, so my dad had to walk to the exit gate where we were left for a good hour before after my repeated discussions with the airport staff, the buggy has finally arrived. Important to know that if you have severe mobility issues to the point that you can not lift your leg, you would never be able to get on this buggy, it is way too high. After a lot of help on my side and with clearly visible pain signs on the face of my mother, we got on the buggy. They took us up to the waiting area at the entrance of the A gates. The area is located in a good walk from any toilet so how do they expect people to use them if they have mobility issues was not particular clear! At some point, we got a message that Turkish Airlines for the 3rd time changed our seats on the plane. Being worried that we will have little time to re-issue the boarding passes, I asked the woman to take us to the gate. The answer was no and she quickly returned to chit-chatting with her male colleague. I asked again with no reaction at all. This infuriated me and I asked for her name to write a complaint. After a short exchange in a broken English on her side, she informed me that now she is cancelling the assistance all together. I started arguing that she can not do it since my mom can not move on her own at all, she completely ignored me. I find it absolutely unacceptable to even suggest cancelling an assistance to someone who can not move on its own.",1,Transit,August 2023,Family Leisure,Transit,3,1,3,1,N/A,1,1

Lots of shops mostly priced in EURO (above EU levels, so be careful) but charged in TRL w/o disclosing exchange rate. Good but overall too few food outlets (National/International). Found only one public water dispenser (however was told by information desk there are two). Too few restrooms, apparently about 25% of what would be required (thus crowded, long queues & dirty). Free WiFi can be had by registering at a few kiosks (queueing and several attempts necessary; needs to be improved).

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  I can confidently say that my recent passage through Istanbul Airport was the most unpleasant experience at an Airport during those 50 years. I was stranded there by Turkish Airlines for 24 hours due to their inability to run to a Timetable, causing me to miss my onward flight to HCMC and eventually causing me to travel to my destination via Dubai instead of direct. The Airport is a nightmare to negotiate with endless walking, impossible Internet Access, almost no seating, ridiculous prices, and a ""Help Desk"" where one is treated to indifference, rudeness, and frankly lies (Paying for Business Class made zero difference). Despite the excessively long walks to Gates, the Departures are often only announced 30 minutes prior to Boarding.

And, you can't even connect to it normally, you have to queue at a kiosk to get a pass code by scanning your passport. I traveled through many airports, have never encountered this. Next, the staff were completely rude to me. The usb ports are faulty, no decent places to rest for long overlays, staff keep kicking you out of gate areas without giving you a reason.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Had to transfer through this airport twice on July 22nd and Aug 4th, 2023. I had two small dessert silver plated forks in my carry on luggage on both dates. On July 22nd, security officer didn’t say anything about the forks in the carry on. On Aug 4th, when going through the security check to board a return flight, security demanded that I give her 2 forks. They took them forcefully and called “garbage”. This is very rude and totally unprofessional to call someone’s belongings “garbage”. These two beautiful forks are over 50 years old. They are a part of a family cutlery collection. That was a reason I didn’t put them in a luggage, as I was afraid to lose them in case luggage is lost. You can’t buy them anywhere. Calling something like this “garbage” is a complete disgrace, disrespect and ignorance. I was begging for giving me options how I could keep them as they are very meaningful to me. So many people were involved in this situation but nobody was trying to help or accommodate or provide a solution. They said forks cannot be taken on a plane for safety reasons. I suggested multiple options to resolve this including paying a fine, but they declined all the options I was giving them to save my forks. They were smiling and happy that they had a power to confiscate someone’s valuable items. I was referred to the Police officer woman, who didn’t care and didn’t bother to help. She was the one who called my silver plated forks “garbage”. When I was talking to her, she was on the video call with her relative. When I pointed that to her, only then she hang up. This is such an unprofessional behavior. Obviously, she didn’t do anything to help to resolve this. This situation made security guards very happy. They felt they are on top of the world for humiliating a passenger. When we were leaving, they were laughing at our backs and wishing us a good flight. Safety concern is a very weak argument, given that forks are allowed in carry on in many countries, including my home country. I also confirmed this with security officers, when came back home. Both dates I flew through 3 different countries and no one made this a problem. Do not tell me that this is an airport rule. All rules are created by people and can be negotiated, accommodated and solutions can be found on common grounds, if willing. There is no even a common international aviation standard on this item. I said to the security, that I am flying with an airline that allow cutlery, including forks, in carry on. On a plane, my meal was served with metal knife and dining size fork! Confiscating my two small dessert forks and claiming it a safety concern was a total shame, they were not even a dining size forks! I have never been to this airport before.

This has got to be one of the worst airports I've ever used and transit at. Despite my flight with Turkish Airlines awful, I had to walk from one side to the other side of the terminal which took like 30 minutes to get to the other side. I think this airport should add more carpets that way it is quieter and it shows no loud sounds of luggage. The transit was not easy where the signs were confusing and too complicated.

Ended up with a flight with an alternative Airline and landed in my destination some 33 hours late.

There was no coordination from ground crew for transit passengers and once you reached the gate, the ground staff are not trained about good customer service, non empathetic to customers and rude. They are fighting in front of delayed customers who missed its flight because of their unorganized and delayed flight. And it seems no body cares about their poor customers. You will see a lot of customers running and missing their connecting flights because of lack of system coordination. And once you missed your flight, ground staff in the gate will only inform the customers to look again for their customer service office because they are not interested at all. Never again!

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Whoever designed this airport is an architect from hell. Yes, it's spectacular in many ways, truly enormous. Does this mean arriving flights can all use a jetway? No, of course not. TK has to manage this the old-fashioned, substandard, suboptimal way, with buses. It's 2023 and this is a brand new airport, for crying out loud. How about a few jetways for aircraft arrivals, then towing the aircraft to a parking spot if it's not to be used again immediately? We had a 2-h transit time and barely made the boarding gate in time (ground staff told me they'd be closing boarding in 5 minutes) - the airport is, simply put, too large, too poorly designed, to enable fit people to walk between arrival and departure areas in less time. How can this be? There should be a train running around the departure gates (A-F), but no, passengers have to thread their way among the hordes of other people trying to do the same thing, while avoiding the central walkway shopping ""opportunities"". Clearly, this bloody airport is designed to maximise sales profits (may all the outlets fail miserably, that's the curse I put on them!) rather than passenger convenience.",1,Transit,July 2023,Family Leisure,Transit,5,2,1,3,1,3,1

At Check in our bags were overweight however the staff was happy to let us go without charging extra or ordering removal of items. Proceeded through immigration and then security check again which I must say is a state of art facility. Unlike Heathrow you don’t need to remove anything from your baggage saving the hassle.

Good only if you have a 3 hours+ stopover, you are fit and you are not travelling with children, it can take 20 minutes at a good pace from your arrival gate to the transfer area, and then another 20 minutes to your new gate. I cannot understand how Turkish Airlines is selling connecting flights with less than 90 minutes connection. They sold a ticket to me with 65 minutes connection! Worst thing is if you miss a connection and you are relocated on a flight the day after, you are going to be assigned an hotel far away (in my case 45 km far away). In fact there are very few hotels near the airport. Just the 300 euros per night Yotel and a Radisson 10km away (also with a rate of 600 euros when I checked on the day I missed the connection).

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | It has some good but a lot of bad things. Despite some of what I've read I would call it highly accommodating in some ways while being intentionally unfriendly in others. The information desk calls in a live video of an agent in the language of your choice. It was well signed and easy for me, someone that has never traveled this side of the world and totally alone, to find my way around with significant ease. The individual accommodations for special use or needs was also impressive. It's massive and quite beautiful. That said, its primary purpose is not to ensure you a smooth trip, rather to is to ensure you buy as much as humanly possible. This is where the problem comes in. If you aren't willing to shell out a A LOT of money then you will not be accommodated. There are lounges and hotels, showers and business centers for hundreds of euros and some have mentioned the airport itself is needlessly large and is intentionally so. The terminals are so wildly far apart as to mandate you sift through an endless regurgitation of a senselessly overpriced 1980's American mall. You'll see the same Bvlgari and Gucci stores 3+ times. The same Behemoth duty free shops are present ad nauseum. But when I say expensive I mean at least double. Everything down to the Wi-Fi is billed and at a high rate. No plugs, little room to sit or actually rest. Flight gates are not posted until 30 minutes before take-off and then are frequently switched. I waited until 7pm for the time of my 720 flight and it sent me to B terminal. When I arrived at B terminal it switched to F. At a cold hard sprint it took me almost 30 minutes to get there. This is both intentional and malicious; its sole purpose is to make you walk by everything one last time. I would boil it down to call it princess toast. If you're unfamiliar with princess toast its toast with glitter and whipped cream, cherries and sprinkles with rainbows and unicorns. Sure its glitz and glam but in the end it's still toast.",3,Transit,April 2023,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,2,5,2,3,1,2

If the food court is busy you will have problems to find a free table to sit down. As the airport has lack of seats most people sit and relax here without eating or drinking anything. I dont liked the options to pick from and i felt they are overpriced. If you register with your passport you only get 1 hour of free internet whats not the fastest.

Internet access is incredibly inconvenient, food options are dismal (for a country with excellent food like Turkey, this is very surprising), moving from one part to the other is slow and inconvenient.  Airport staff is just ok. Depending on SMS messages for wifi connectivity is a very wrong idea. First, roaming is difficult between many countries. But mostly, even if it works, it adds incredible hassle for a situation where one needs fast, clear, and quick data to let someone home one made it safely, to warn somebody one has arrived, to check a last-minute hotel information.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Such a huge and pretty airport terminal, but there is not enough seating, restrooms/toilets, and it's a long walk to your gate. It's hard to find your check-in counter for your airline. The same people who checked me in at the counter were also there at the gate. The staff are the most rude, surly, people who don't know (or pretend to not know) English and are very unhelpful and useless. The customs agent was on her phone texting on WhatsApp and was annoyed that I interrupted her to do her job of checking my passport and visa. The WiFi, which is very slow, only lasts one hour, and they ask for your phone number and/or your passport number for some bizarre reason. Food is expensive and overpriced. No public transit into the city at all. They keep saying it's under construction, but why wasn't it built and included in the first place?",3,Arrival and Departure,September 2022,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,1,3,1,1,1,1
Istanbul,One of the best airports that I have been through. Signage is very good. Terminal is super clean. Shopping is amazing. The food is fantastic. This airport has a quality which has not been seen by me anywhere else. Staff are very professional. Wifi service is not good. But I have not seen any airport with good wifi. I think western passengers travelling through this airport should compare it with something like Atlanta or Heathrow both of which are pretty much living in the past. The tall ceilings and Ottoman architecture that's been used in a subtle fashion adds to the uniqueness of this airport terminal. I believe 2 women architect's designed this airport terminal.,9,Departure Only,August 2022,Family Leisure,Departure Only,5,4,5,5,5,3,4
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Large airport that has directory maps throughout. Very hard to find anyone that spoke English as well as could help us around. Too many security points. Bags and passports checked numerous, numerous times. Reluctantly had to pay visa fee in order to claim my pet for the several hours while in transit. Between the heavy security, and Turkish flags draped at many retail stores, I didn’t feel comfortable, and would do my best to avoid this airport if at all possible.",1,Transit,August 2022,Family Leisure,Transit,3,1,1,2,1,1,1

There was even a Shake Shack there, which I couldn't believe. This is a fine airport, much better than what we have in the US, and I have to wonder what it is that makes our airports inferior to that of our European counterparts. Money? Lack of interest?

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Arrived on 5/12/2022 at IST and departed on 5/21/2022. This gleaming bright airport merits its 5 Star rating that is prominently displayed in the concourse. On arrival, there was a long walk to passport control. The lighting and signs directing passengers are very clear. The baggage claim area is massive and resembles that of LAS airport. No wait for our luggage as they were already on the carousel. It took no more than 10 minutes to get through passport control. Departed on 5/21/2022. There is heavy security screening. On entering the terminal, one has to pass the luggage through scanners before proceeding to check in counters. IST has a special entrance for Business Class and Star Alliance Gold passengers. Another security check followed before proceeding to check our bags and proceeding to the Business Lounge. Directions were easy to follow to the lounge. The concourse is brightly lit and there are shops from various designer labels throughout. At the departure gate, there is another security check i.e. handheld baggage is inspected and body is hand scanned.",10,Arrival and Departure,May 2022,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,N/A,5,0,5,N/A,5
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airport experience I’ve had. Approaching staff to ask for help, I received a very short and unhelpful answer.  I finally had help from a police officer who was stationed outside the airport door, when i realised i couldn’t go back in, he explained how to get to where i wanted. Plus i got scammed by the Global Exchange in the airport. I saw the passport control officer going over people’s passport with magnifying glasses - don't they have machines for that?

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  The airport is brand new and huge. The facilities are great in general but with a few improvement points. There are not enough water dispensers. I only spotted 1 in the departure hall (and no sign for it, you need to find it with your sharp eyes) and not near gates, which means you have to buy bottle water from the airport stores. Unlike HKG where there are multiple security checkpoints throughout the concourses for transit passengers, there is only one in Istanbul Airport (right under the departure hall) so transit passengers come to the main hall and go through duty free shops before you can board your next flight even it's next to your previous one. The transit security queue is long even in the early morning 5-6AM and the security staff are not friendly. WiFi is only free for limited time which is unfriendly to passengers with long transit.",6,Transit,April 2022,Business,Transit,5,4,4,0,3,1,1

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  During transit, you will find a Burger King and a Simit Sarayi. If you got out of the airport , did some sightseeing and entered the airport again, so this is Departures, you will find lot of posh stores and a flute player in the middle. If you want food, you have to go to the Food court on the upper floor where you will find Carl's Jnr, Popeye's, Subways and a pasta place. Food in the airport is expensive! I had a Chicken burger meal and chicken strips and the bill came to £18 at Carl's Jnr. I would advise you to find the Turkish restaurants on the ground floor which are opposite the Yotel airport hotel. Here, you can have local Turkish food and doner kebap as well. 2 x small lamb doner kebaps & chips cost me £17 while rice and meatball curry cost me £8. WiFi is also very restrictive. You have to scan your passport and use the generated code to login to WIFI or get a text (if roaming is enabled on your phone ) and it only lasts an hour.",5,Arrival and Departure,April 2022,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,5,2,3,1,5
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have never found an airport as confusing, poorly laid out and with no information desks as IST. The signage is awful. I tried following the signs to Turkish Business lounge, but it is almost impossible. You think you are heading in the correct direction because every so often you see a sign with a very small logo arrow pointing you one way, but then the signs stop. Staff were rude when I asked where the lounge was. All I got out of them was vague and hand signals.",3,Transit,April 2022,Business,Transit,4,1,1,2,N/A,2,1
Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified |  They have a big airport but very inconvenient. Take ages to pass through gates Too less gate for lots of passengers. No one control and so many people cut into queues.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the misfortune of traveling through Istanbul to Dammam with Turkish Airlines. The airline customer care and visa information centers do not speak English and do not bother to try and assist passengers. They were asking for vaccination records through Sehaty App, which we do not use to show our vaccination records, we use Tawakalna. The Turkish airlines staff did not allow us to board the flight in spite of showing them printed copies of Health certificate clearly stating the vaccination records as well as our residency permit for Saudi Arabia. And unfortunately we could not open neither Sehaty or Tawakalna App. There were Turkish passengers who tried to explain the situation to the airline staff ... but their reasoning fell on deaf ears. The visa information counter staff asked me in Turkish to apply evisa online in spite of me explaining that I am on my way to Dammam and I have just arrived from Dalaman. Absolutely no understanding of what I was trying to explain. So I was forced to apply for evisa after paying $48 (Scam). The airport staff who are well dressed with suit and neckties, when you ask them a question in English, they give you a blank look and try to ignore and walk away. I had a horrific experience and I am expressing my disgust and informing passengers. This is my second time I have missed my flight because of their ignorance and unsuitable staff.  They need a lot of training and changes to handle such a big airport. I will never use the Istanbul Airport or the Turkish Airlines ever again.

Istanbul,"Not Verified |  My visit to this airport was, and I do not use this word lightly, traumatic. A colleague and I were redirected there due to a missed flight from Canada on our way to Cairo, Egypt. To say the staff was ill trained, rude, dismissive and grossly overwhelmed is an understatement. I will share the most egregious of the issues. When we first arrived, there was no one to help us understand what was next. Our connection was delayed and thus we missed our flight in Turkey to Cairo. We had to wander the airport with little to no direction to include many misdirection's and were actually rudely waved off like insignificant pests at one point without a word from airport staff that we attempted to approach for directions. Because of the delays (not all on Istanbul airport but certainly not helped by the staff) we had to take an additional COVID test because the time limit on ours ran out. The testing area was super hard to find and there was not good signage for it. Additionally a very angry worker rammed the instrument up our noses (I saw the person before us, my colleague and myself literally stagger back after the test) so violently I literally saw stars. He complained of pain a full day later. Turkish Airlines would not redirect us from our missed flight. We had to purchase additional tickets to be able to make it to Cairo. We went to the baggage handling area to retrieve our luggage. The man I spoke to glanced at my luggage receipt, and dismissively told me our bags had been routed to Cairo. He didn't check a screen or ask anyone. This he did while breezing by me as he left a busy line of people. When we arrived in Cairo, our luggage was, you guessed it, lost in the Istanbul airport. I certainly hope that these negative reviews prompt some change there. I will never step foot in that airport again if I have any power at all. I feel like, they are the face of the country and they have given Turkey a very bad impression on me.",2,Transit,November 2021,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,1,1,3,N/A,2,1

I was the only person at the cafe to order an espresso, the lady at cafe saw me, but didn't acknowledge me. I waited for 5 minutes (giving her the benefit of the doubt because she may have been busy) another man walked up to the counter, she came over to help him right away and then I walked away. I couldn't get access to the internet because because my passport would not scan, staff told me to call a number to get help, I called, they could not help. I will try to avoid using this airport for transits even if I have to pay more to transit at another airport.

Istanbul,"Not Verified |  What happens when ego is huge but there is no substance to back it up. Gleaming new airport is one of pet projects of Turkish president. It is huge to say the least. The rest lack some serious attention. It is highly disorganized with insufficient staff support. You are first screened for security at the entrance which creates huge lines. We subsequently waited for business check in for >30minutes. At one point the single person serving us left. Afterwards you go through quick passport check for international flights. Second security check is also decent. There is only one business lounge for international departures which makes crowding a certainty. That being said they do have an omelette station which was freshly prepared by several chefs. At the gate there is another security check. No announcements at all so people rush when they think the check in has started which creates chaos in a small space dedicated to the gate. Overall, staff are poorly motivated to help, signs are lacking and there are very few seats in the general area. There are two ways of getting wifi - text and scanning your passport. Text didn't work when we were there and scanning stations are very few.

Istanbul,"Not Verified |  This is the worst airport I've ever had to visit in my life. What kind of airport is it where not even announcements are made? Missed the flight and booked a new ticket with money that I just happened to have with me, thank goodness. Actually, I shouldn't have to pay any money for a ticket that I shouldn't have needed if there were competent staff and a good system where announcements were made about when the gates would close. It was a terrible time, most likely even infected with Corona there because we had no more food and someone gave us something out of pity. We even almost missed our second flight because again nothing was announced. It was such a traumatic experience for us that we will hopefully never fly with Turkish Airlines again. Just recently a work colleague told me she has exactly the same experience. Really a shame this airport, just plain embarrassing.

After about 20 min of walking, asking around 5 persons (!) and trying to find a trolley or a plastic stroller I was refused to use one, and was threatened with the police by the staff if I use one. You have a paid small trolleys but after the passport check. There's no open wifi, you must log in with your passport in special point which was not working.

This is despite the fact, that passenger numbers are still not where they might have been normally (post covid). There is a lack of sockets to power the laptop or mobile phone.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Architecturally and engineering-wise a very good looking building. And that’s were the good things end. I have traveled a lot, been to at least 15 international airports, from the smallest like ZAD to the giants like FRA. First of all, this airport and all its services are severely understaffed. Check-in counters are abundant, but only 15% of them are staffed. Same goes for the border control. There are two security checks, one when entering the building, and one after passport control. They are essentially same, which means one of them is a redundancy and a loss of at least 30 minutes of Your time. Never in my whole life have I arrived earlier at an airport. I was there almost four hours prior to the departure, and I barely made it to the gate in time. 80 check-in desks were operated by 20 personnel, and to add even more bad news, they were excruciatingly slow. Info displays are small and there are not nearly enough of them. After the passport control and the second security check, I saw on the display that my flight had only 5 minutes left to board. I ran and ran just to arrive and see that everything was late and I had 45 more minutes to sit and wait. So the main display was not up to date with information. There is no simple Wi-Fi solution, neither paying nor free, You need at least 15 minutes to make that work, and that’s if You know what You’re doing. I couldn’t check what the restaurants and shops offer at all because I was in a hurry, so I’ll leave that out. Last but not least, is the sheer distance from the city (Istanbul) and the means of transportation (or lack thereof). The best and only option for now is to hire a private shuttle or a taxi(cab). The public transport options like metro or high speed train are non-existent at the moment. If, after all you’ve read, you find yourself departing from this airport, please get there at least five or more hours before the planned departure. Anything later than that is too stressful, especially if You are aware that all the problems could be solved with 3-5 times more staff that could work there.",2,Departure Only,August 2021,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,5,1,4,0,N/A,1,1

I have been travelling back and forth every 2 months for almost 2 years now, the most striking feature is that no one speaks any other language than Turkish and we are talking about an international airport here! Staff are not helpful at all they are rude and become aggressive very easily. They pretend they understand what you say only to send you off to another person who in turn will send you off to another person. And this is how you end up walking this huge airport back and forth for hours! They change flight times and gates at their leisure. A few months back I had missed my plane because of their last minute rescheduling, at the info desk there was a (very) pregnant lady who had not only missed her connection flight but for some reason had one of her children stuck somewhere in another gate or something. Another guy had missed his flight to his wedding (one flight/week). About the signs: maybe you should update your signalling: after covid many of the exits are now closed. So you might see a ""cikis"" (exit) sign, only to find out that it is closed and that you need to go somewhere else. A very frustrating airport!

There are people sitting on the floor everywhere, even sleeping on the bare tiles. It’s shameful that such a new airport with all the mod cons not provide comfortable seats for the passengers in transit.

Most eateries are upmarket but upstairs hidden there are a few fast food outlets. A nice sports bar too. And a smoking balcony which is a bonus for some. Poor seating and many people sitting on the floors. Look upstairs for some additional quiet areas with less crowds. Free wifi for only one hour! Be prepared. Security is quick and efficient.

Supervisor did this as well. They all do this because they genuinely do not care about your problem. Wifi only connects for an hour, after that you have to pay. It takes a really long time to get to your gate or anywhere you need to go because the airport is excessively too big. If a senior were to visit this airport it would be very difficult for them to acquire assistance because of the lack of genuine readiness to assist foreign travellers in dire need of help. If they needed a ride on an electric wheelchair operated by service staff, they prompt you to pay them 20 Euro. What a joke? I missed my flight because of the lack of genuine assistance as well as not taking responsibility and reimbursing my flight, instead, I had to pay more money for another flight all together and remained in the airport for an additional 12 hours. Nobody cared about the problems the staff created for me nor the inconvenience they put me in. Do not recommend.",1,Departure Only,January 2021,Business,Departure Only,5,3,5,3,3,1,1

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | All beauty, no substance. Clearly built to look nice, not to actually be easy to use, for the same reasons several reviewers have already mentioned. Distances are huge, it takes one hour to get to your gate and it can change all of a sudden and leave you stranded. Internet lasts very little and then you have to pay.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | From Amsterdam to Istanbul to Bali transfer. Twice we saw gate F16. So we go to sit there, from where we came out we had to walk a few kilometres to get to F16. Very tired. Its a very big airport. After an hour or so, the plane was going from another gate. We were surprised. Service desk was very rude, not helpful and laughed at what was happening to us. It was our fault because you have to watch the departure display every 10 minutes and was told gate numbers changes very often. On the ticket there was no gate number. Internet is very difficult, absolutely not easy. Most don't understand English. Finally we bought two single tickets back to Amsterdam and our holiday was a disaster. We lost almost E1300 euro for nothing. I traveled many times and saw many airports, this is the worst airport I ever saw. Hospitality is very bad for tourists. You have to walk very long distances from gate to gate.",2,Transit,January 2020,Couple Leisure,Transit,4,3,1,3,4,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  A modern and spacious airport. Being a new one, state of the art buildings, architecture, and decoration, most travellers were a bit confused meeting new everything in IST. That resulted in a degree of discomfort and a lot of effort walking here and there to find what they needed.  Most of junior staff that passengers meet everywhere in IST speak their mother tongue only. It would help a lot if those in contact with passengers are offered courses in basic English, French, or Dutch language.  A noticeable number of staff and employee were tense. Probably, the huge influx of passengers caused by Covid-19 pandemic and the huge volume of work created tension or aggrevated it. Both passengers and IST staff were under pressure. A relatively modest number of employees and staff at IST were really nice, calm, and helpful. On my way to the gates to board I requested assistance from those two young employees. They got two wheelchairs and made sure we were comfortable. Thank you Ihsan and Aysun.  A good point was made by a Turkish Airlines staff at check in desk. She offered us taking our carry on bags with the check in luggage. That was a nice gesture especially with senior people freeing them from carrying bags throughout the layover hours. In our particular case it was almost 11 hours.  Potable water is not available in the airport. The price of the smallest bottle in airport shops is unbelievably high.",7,Arrival and Departure,March 2020,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,3,4,1,1,1,3
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  I had the worst experience with this airport. I lost my phone in one of the airport bathrooms. I went to customer services and the lost and found office to ask about it, everyone was saying I don’t know and sent me to another office. For 2 hours I was walking around myself and I was pregnant and tired, finally a girl from one of the customer services told me to ask at the police office and here my suffering started again. There are no police officers that can speak English, only one understood what I wanted to say and helped me to find my phone, but there was a bigger problem that they refused to give me my phone immediately. I don’t know why and I waited again in the police office for 4 hours watching them laughing, eating and drinking tea. Their boss eventually came to help me get my phone after paying 20 USD. I don’t recommend this airport to anyone. If you forced to choose this airport for any reason, please stay close to your gate as the airport is so big.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible experience at this newly built airport earlier today! Travelled from Cape Town, SA to London Heathrow with a transfer in Istanbul Airport. Although very modern, clean and very very large, the staff are atrocious, not helpful in any way and not friendly. I had bought some metal sculptures in SA, which were conviscated at security in Istanbul as apparently they were 'sharp'. We couldn't put them in our checked suitcases as we thought they were too fragile. I disputed it, and the security officer told me to backtrack through security and speak to the Turkish Airlines desk to get them to put it in hold luggage. After fighting back through the security lines, the man on the desk spoke terrible English, and simply said its not possible due to 'procedures' but wouldn't elaborate. So we then had to line up and go through security again with the end result, we lost our expensive art sculptures, and wasted lots of time through misinformation. To top it off we had to run across the airport to the gate, narrowly avoiding missing our flight, to find out that someone else in our travel party had brought a 2 litre bottle of water through security and they hadn't even noticed.",2,Transit,March 2020,Family Leisure,Transit,5,N/A,1,0,N/A,N/A,1

WiFi is the worst in the world - good luck trying to connect to it with the code they never text you. It’s too large and inefficient. Getting from A to B is just immensely time consuming - even if transiting make sure you’ve got at least 2-3hrs transit time because your gate might be on the side of the planet they’ve built. Customer service is lacking. The queues at passport control are too long and there are always empty desks which means they can get more staff in if they really cared.

Although EURO is not a Turkish currency, all of the airport shops ask for EURO and price is too high than any other par of the world. 'Global Exchange' cheats the tourists by delivering US $1 = less than 5 Lira and 1 EUR = less than 6 lira . In reality , the exchange rate was US $1 = 5.87 Lira and 1 EUR = 6.65 lira . If one wants to exchange Lira with USD they ask for more than 7 Lira for 1 US $. They say they offer the best deal and charge no commission. Airport taxis are awful: they do not speak in English and the drivers drive such a way so that tourists cannot reach their destinations easily.

A tiring, huge, heartless, could-be-anywhere shopping mall, with frustratingly clunky WiFi (even in the IAG business lounge – worked the first time, but not the second), long distances to cover on foot for no apparent reason other than megalomania, an unnecessarily complicated system for airport carts, a long time from landing to getting to the terminal (by bus) – in short: a lot of Wow! when you first arrive, but no useful lessons learnt from other international airports.

Without even listening to my query he signalled over his shoulder towards passport control, even though I was in transit! I even met a young female traveller who, due to misguidance by airport staff missed two flights.

Everything is priced in Euros, with a scandalously expensive, rip off exchange rate to Turkish lira, though this aspect has latterly been addressed.

Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified | My flight is from Istanbul to Delhi. And to be honest this is the most expensive and heartless airport ever. Even poor countries have better amenities than this. I was at gate 15 and not a single place I could find a place to drink water. Then I found out in this airport we have to pay for everything. Even for a basic thing like water. I love in Australia now and to be honest there are water spouts all over the airport even for children they have a lower height spout. This is utter cheapness on behalf of Istanbul airport as water is a basic thing and they force people to buy water. A normal bottle of Fiji costs almost 7 USD. Seriously.

I told the official there that many people are still at the old gate and needed to be reminded. He said “It is the duty of the traveller to be vigilant and be alert and look out for anything that may change.” I told him maybe they needed to announce on the PA the people (some in wheelchairs) to come to the new door.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's big but that's as far as it went with the positives, in fact the size was a negative point. The runway is so far from the main terminal that it took almost 15mins to get to the terminal! Why would you design it that way? If you're transiting through this airport you have to walk incredibly far to get to security .. so if you're running on a tight schedule this is not the airport to be transiting through. Why didn't they design the transiting process like Hong Kong with a security point every few hundred meters? The shops lack diversity with so many duty free shops selling the same stuff. Would have expected a lot more variety with food options but even this was limited. The gates are numbered extremely strangely. Rather than having gates numbered A1, A2 A3 etc they've used A1A, A1B, etc so signs would say gates A, B, C in this direction when in fact they mean gate A1A, A1B ... very confusing! I visited the IGN lounge which is situated on the 2nd floor and this view point you can see how unclean this airport is. You really notice all the dust and how poorly the place is put together. Only one hour free WiFi provided. Really disappointed with this.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I did the trifecta at Istanbul Airport: transit, arrival, and departure for my second travel experience this year at Istanbul Airport. Compared to my visit in April more shops and eating areas have opened, there was less apparent construction activity on the inside of the airport, and most of the dust seems to have settled. Queuing times for immigration, check in, and security were acceptable. Your luggage is already waiting for you at the carousel when you arrive. The bathrooms were clean and spotless and there are plenty of places to sit. Taxing to the gate varies but nothing longer than 15-20 minutes. I understand that WiFi is an issue but I had purchased a 30 day data plan from my mobile carrier so I had no need to use WiFi. The airport app is a must as it has a map, shows you where your gate will be before it appears on the information screens, and gives you notifications about your flight as well. Istanbul Airport is also a 45 minute drive from Sultanahmet so not as bad as I was expecting. If you get the airport app, do a bit of research, and make sure that your transit is more than an hour you will have no problem navigating around Istanbul Airport.",9,Arrival and Departure,December 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,2,5
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I have now flown through Istanbul Airport five times and each time I told myself - I will give it another chance.

Staff at this airport will go out of their way to make your journey / experience as unpleasant as they can. If you ask a question twice, they will roll their eyes. They will treat you very badly. Not to mention lazy. Forget going above and beyond, the ground staff made my transfer as horrible as possible. Unfortunately, I still have one return flight I have to make, which I will. I just landed and my experience was so bad that I had to look up whether it was the same for others. And yes, it was. Avoid this airport at all costs. I will never ever fly through Istanbul again. Even if I have to pay for money for another ticket and fly longer. The staff are just hateful. Don't fly through here. Oh and the wifi doesn't work.

Moreover from the time you enter to the plane until the final take off the pilot can drive more tahn 20 minutes (taxi time). The worst thing is that they provide only 1 hour of poor wifi service whereas at other famous airport hubs like Singapore you have unlimited speed wifi.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Istanbul Airport to Milano. Using this airport since opening. The airport and facilities are rapidly improving, the airport management is really learning by experiencing it. They need urgently new lounges. This time I was unlucky and had a gate that was far away, had to walk for 15min, but at some other airport you will find the same, understandable. The only big minus is the rude security staff at entering terminal that can not even put 3 basic English words together and be nice and have a smile. The ladies security especially are far worse. Can not even say hello, please, welcome, wait please or any basic word that they need at their level of work. They need to learn in total 5 basic sentences to welcome people and help them, but no none of them learn. Besides the security check point, the overall experience is pleasant.

With all my confident I can say this is not an airport, it looks like a shopping mall From one gate to another one, you should consider walking about 20 to 30 minutes. I am not sure what was the purpose of having this huge airport without considering the amount of time and energy one passenger should spend only to finds his/ her gate. What a waste of money. The surprising part of this airport is the sides that still under construction and trucks still working.  One question remains to be answered for me. I do not know why when I was about to come to Canada, the security guard did take pictures of my Canadian passport without asking for my consent.

Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified | If you read signs this is so easy. You dont need to ask staff because everything was written on signs. It was not complicated.

Free WiFi difficult to activate and some websites are not allowed (including Wikipedia) Friendly and helpful staff, but not always with sufficient English knowledge. No fast connections to the city center, which is far away. Complex shuttle bus network for the main areas of the city.

However, there were no trolleys in the car park for someone who has many bags to pull. Also, there is the problem of getting a trolley at the arrivals for someone coming for the first time to the airport. He needs 5 TL to get a trolley which he may not have raedy on him.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Transited from long haul international to short haul international. Required walking across from Terminal B to Terminal F. It was a long walk. No moving walkway across the main terminal which is largely an open luxury shopping mall. With a 3 year old, it was quite a challenge (used a luggage cart for her to ride on). For some people, this kind of exciting, fun walk may be more of a burden if they just want to transit to their next flight and move on. Food selections were lame. Internet is awful. Had high end shopping options, but can get those at home. Transiting meant I didn't have a Turkish SIM card so I couldn't get a text with an access code for internet which would be limited to an hour or two anyway. Bathrooms were ok (new.)

Toilets smell and the floors and seats are often damaged and disgusting. The airport is poorly planned. They only recently increased the number of signs but it is still insufficient to understand walking distance. Excessive walking, it’s an abuse of passengers and traveling through this airport robs an extra 2 hrs every roundtrip in addition to usual transit times. Planes take 30 minutes to park and the gates are too far away from baggage claim. They force you to pay up 6 euros anytime you want to use a buggy.

Much more time if you have to get taxes back.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul new airport is frustrating, way too big and with much limited assistance service compared to other main airports. The architecture is boring and there are really long walking distances. In the group of 10 persons, we needed assistance for three. There were wheelchairs at the arrival gate, but too few, and staff were not very communicative, mainly because of a lack of knowledge in English. There were 2-3 waiting areas, way too crowded and chaotic, and our assistance people were just delivered at the gate, having to wait a long time before the rude boarding - very bad! I have to notice, that even the otherwise always polite Turkish Airlines did not add anything positive to our experience, there are no pre-boarding for disabled, as is the case in other major airlines.",3,Transit,October 2019,Business,Transit,3,3,2,0,3,N/A,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified | I traveled with Turkish Air from Sharm el Shiek wanting to transfer to Turkish air to continue to Manchester. Our plane was delayed in Egypt and took 15 min from landing to exiting. I followed the signs for international transfers and found a gate for passengers with a short transfer time. Unfortunately, it was locked and unstaffed. This required me to continue to the end of the concourse and then return down a parallel one to go through security. Security took maybe 10-minutes after which I had a 10-minute sprint to my departure gate. By this time it had closed resulting in a 24-stay and £200 each to rebook. Every agent I spoke to told me the airline was having many problems with short transfer times. It would require the quick transfer gate to be open and rapid progress through security and strong legs to make this transfer successfully. I don’t believe I would ever return to such a shambles again.",5,Transit,October 2019,Couple Leisure,Transit,5,5,2,4,4,N/A,3
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  This is a huge airport that is a little bit far from the city. Arrival was easy with a cab but it is also easy with the airport shuttles that run regularly 24/7. The entrance to the airport through a security check is smooth as well. If you checked in before your arrival at the airport, all you have to do is walk to the second security check and finding your gate. This is where the problems start as you have to walk a lot. On the way back, I don't know why, after the landing, the planes go on the taxi mode for at least 10 minutes until reaching the final parking position. This seems highly inefficient to me. I hope they can address the long walk after the flight, too. Last time after the landing from a domestic flight, leaving the airport without waiting for a bag took us 30 mins, so plan accordingly.",5,Arrival and Departure,October 2019,Business,Arrival and Departure,4,2,5,3,5,5,4
Istanbul,"Not Verified | Waiting in the F1A gate waiting area suddenly the airport staff ask everyone to stand up and get out of the gated waiting area just because they wanted to check passports while they should have done this when everyone got in the waiting area in the first place.

Very bad system.",4,Departure Only,October 2019,Business,Departure Only,4,3,3,3,3,1,2
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  Pathetic informative boards, not enough, not big enough, lack of information anywhere, staff not prepared. I flew Bologna to India return via Istanbul and forth in October. The incoming flight, it took 25 minutes for the aircraft to reach parking after landing. When out of the gate, no information screen was nearly available to know to which gate to go to. Board to different terminals is small and at times hidden behind pillars. Time consuming walking time (30 minutes) from terminal F to terminal D with no kart passing by to make it faster and smooth. Outbound flight, again same problem: no screens, people looking around wondering where to go. Staff unresponsive. Again rushing from a terminal to another. I never saw before, in any airport, so many people literally running from a place to another due to fool distance between gates. Time consuming before aircraft reaches parking spot, runways too far. Not enough and not often karts to take people from a terminal to another. Too many shops, empty as people do not have the time to shop, busy running to catch the flight.

Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified | It was honestly really good. I had an issue with my Emirati visa for returning home because my UAE visa was not showing in their system so I was told to go the supervisor who apologised for the inconvenience and wished me a safe trip. Passport control was a breeze and they had free buggy services which I recommend you take. I know Turkish somewhat so perhaps that improved my experience but everything was on time no delay. I especially loved the food court and there are like 4 of them a bit overpriced but airports always are but the staff was super friendly. I even got away with 2kgs of extra baggage can’t really ask for more it’s a bit behind terminal 3 (DXB) but way better than terminal 2 and 1 (DXB),10,Departure Only,September 2019,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,4,4,5,0,4,N/A,5
Istanbul,"Not Verified | It's so strange people have a negative impression of the new Istanbul airport. I have been here twice since July 2019. Facilities are marvellous. Immigration and security process is very smooth and takes far less time than any other international airport. The seating at every gate is excellent. If you have a long stay at the airport, you can take rest on easy chairs. Only improvement areas are; WiFi facility and English speaking staff. Better would be to have a minimum transit time of 2 hours. It's a big airport so it takes some time to arrive at designated gates.",7,Transit,August 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,4,4,3,3,1,3
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  Shockingly rude staff and huge airport - which is an absolute nightmare for transitting through the airport for a connection flight. I missed my flight due to my flight not even showing up on the screen! This set off a chain reaction of interaction with airport and airline staff that ranges from completely indifferent to downright rude and aggressive. The information points are completely useless - with staff sitting around on their phones, hardly bothering to look up at you as you approach them. The wifi situation is horrendous. Forget getting the free airport wifi if you don't have a local SIM. The only restaurant with any wifi (bad wifi at that) is burger restaurant on the lower level. Signs aren't clear, and the toilet placement/situation is confusing. The only pro is that the commercial shopping area is decent, so you can throw money into the companies granted concessions there. Avoid.",1,Transit,September 2019,Business,Transit,2,1,1,2,3,1,1

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Never experienced such bad airport. Start already from the runway as the plane has to take a detour of approx 40min before reaching the gate but guess TK instructed the flight deck to switch off ADS as soon as they hit the ground so it looks Turkish is always on time. The whole airport is so bad if you get gate at the end you have to walk for another 30min until you reach the security then all the way back. Sure they have some short connections place but still. Shopping sure looks like Dubai mall but finding a place to eat impossible. Not worth buying anything as you will find it cheaper outside. And just the same brands as everywhere else. Turkey has so many things to offer but just the same French/Italian brands. Staff, well okay I would say. Could be worse. It’s supposed to be brand new but so many small holes and things missing it already looks like an old airport. Imagine 5 years later. Avoid to all cost!

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | The airport is simply too big. You have to walk far too long and the expected consequence is missed transfers - I had a connection flight and my first flight from London was delayed for 40 minutes. I would still have caught my flight at another airport, but it was impossible in Istanbul. I had to spend another 120 euros for staying the night at the airport hotel as Turkish Airlines refused to provide accommodation, saying my next flight has to be at least 12 hours ahead. Mine was 11 hours. In the old airport, this was eight hours but probably because so many people miss their connection flights, the Turkish Airlines extended this to 12 hours for the new airport. I will avoid this airport in the future and the Turkish Airlines as well - they're too risky with connection flights.",1,Transit,September 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

I was flying to London, and I had to pass 4 different security checks for non-sense reasons! Rude staff, I had my ticket on my Wallet app, and the lady at the check she insisted to print  one for me.

I just had the experience of one of the security checkers, shouting at me, snatching my boarding pass out of my hand, pushing me and then most hilarious of all refusing to allow me to pass the security check by chucking my tray away. I went to another line, passed and then they came running over to stop me and calling the supervisor. The discussion was all in Turkish as none of these people spoke English (how is this possible at an international airport?) and a kind passenger translated for me. Of course they ganged up to say that I refused to show the boarding pass which was a lie and when I accused them of shoving me and the lady tried to defend the guy but at least he didn't lie - I received an apology and a warning - to never argue with them as you could be refused boarding.

They thought nothing was wrong and then she called me and she demanded them to bring us to her.

Every desk sent you to another desk, and it's incredible how many who work in this airport are rude. But the most crazy thing is that a lot of them didn't speak English, and they work in an international airport! I went to the international transfer desk to ask about my baggage, and the girl didn't speak one word of English. Last but not least, the WiFi. I don't understand how can an international airport give only 60 minutes of WiFi without the possibility to buy mb or extend the time. So if you need to communicate with someone outside the airport and you have already used your 60 minutes, you can't.

As the Airport Personal picked up my father from the Aircraft, he just bring him to the Airport and that's it! The Airport Personal wanted money from my dad because he picked him up from the Aircraft! I've never heard that we have to pay a Service fee for only bringing an old man from the plane?! So first he wanted 50 TL for the service, but we haven't got Turkish Lira! So he wanted 50 EUR from my dad?!  I'm very dissapointed about the staff!

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Since its opening I have been traveling via Istanbul Airport once a month, both domestic and international. I have noticed that the airport administration has been gradually improving the service, cleanliness and other facilities at the airport. It took 35 minutes to arrive to the airport from the Maslak district of the city by car. Considering Istanbul's traffic conditions it is quite good. The security check took less than five minutes which is very good compared to old Atatürk Airport. The airport has plenty of outlets, restaurants and cafes together with enough numbers of seating at the gates. It was a 10 minute walk to go to my gate after the security control which is very good at this mega size airport. The longest gate would need 15 minutes walk. Overall the new Istanbul Airport is getting better administered yet there are still some place to improve such as the cleaning especially the windows overlooking the planes and airbridges. Perhaps installation of information kiosks would be beneficial.",9,Departure Only,August 2019,Business,Departure Only,4,5,4,5,5,4,4

We were asked to pay for a Turkish visa before we get access to the hotel they are offering us to stay till the next day. Something we never had any plans for because we were not expecting to stay there that long at the airport if their flight from JFK hadn’t delayed. Took us 8hrs after arrival to get to the hotel!

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Me, my wife and my one year old baby arrived at Istanbul airport from Bangalore, India on the 17th August. 2019 We had a layover of 15 hours and was clearly mentioned on the Turkish airline website that we would be eligible for a Transit hotel for our time at Istanbul. We flew Indigo airlines from Bangalore via Delhi to Istanbul which was a code shared flight with Turkish airlines. Their website had clearly stated that the codeshared flight passengers were also eligible to avail transit hotel as our flight from Istanbul to Berlin was Turkish airlines the next day. After we got out and reached the Turkish Airlines Hotel desk they denied us any service stating that they do not know anything about Indigo airlines being a codeshare partner with Turkish airlines and was very rude in their behaviour when they asked us to leave. We were shocked to see the Turkish Airlines staff behaving in such a way and was completely devastated. We had a crying baby and we had no one to even guide us with any useful information at all. My wife even begged them to help us find an accommodation as we were new to the place and it was late in the night. The just denied! This was a first experience in our life were an airline staff behaved in such a ruthless manner. We were sad and completely lost and with a help of a private hotel desk staff close to the Turkish airline hotel desk who was witnessing what we were going through called us and offered help. We payed for our stay, the taxi and everything and left the city for good the next day.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Not an enjoyable airport to depart from. We had to queue in 4 different queues before we could enter the terminal. It took 1hr 45m to get in, which was okay because we gave ourselves plenty of time but is also way too long. The staff at the security checks don't bother to speak English, which is weird given it's an international airport and certainly not mostly Turkish people. There are poor food options that are almost all take away. Barely any restaurants, no Turkish food in sight which was a shame too. As a brand new airport it doesn't make sense that it's so inefficient really. There were plenty of security checkpoints and passport control desks not in use.

I could not believe that the information desk offered no help. The staff were rude and had no manners in any sense.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  My connection was - 1:50 hours. Plane landed on time. I think the taxi to gate was about 10 minutes. Took another 7 minutes to deplane as I took the advice of this forum and checked in exactly 24 hours before the flight and could get 5 rows from the front of economy. It then took around 10 minutes to get from B9 to the security check via the longer way (not using the short connection), 5 minutes to do security and another 7 minutes to get to A3. This was done with a sleepy 6 years old girl and a slightly more awake 9 years old boy. We got to the gate 1:20 before the flight departed, about 45 minutes before boarding started, leaving enough time for my kids to start fighting. Airport was new, clean, including the bathrooms with electronically activated faucets. The only negative is that the gate area is very small.

We were only in transit at Istanbul airport, we were very disappointed and annoyed to be asked for the visas when their visas have nothing to do with Turkey and Turkish airlines, Malaysia airlines, who flew us into Australia did not even ask for the visas. What right does the airport have to ask for these visas, which are electronic! As the airport does not provide free Wi-Fi, like most other airports do, I could not even consider using VEVO. I stated to the persons asking for the visas as we were checking in, that the visas are electronic and we have no paper copies and no Wi-Fi- so no VEVO, let me speak to someone of authority otherwise I suggest you let us board the aircraft, they said ""it's okay, proceed through"" My question I have, what right does the airport have to ask a passenger in transit for their visa for another country, a country which their airline does not take the passenger to?

To start with the airport is huge and although that may seem a good thing soon one starts realizing that walking 30 minutes hike with kids or luggage is not a fun experience. This airport was build to impress not to be functional and it isn't. There is no way to reach your transfer flight in less than 2-3 hours, impossible I tell you. and if you are going to Canada, UK or US you got to start planning for 4 hours minimum. The airport is tiring and super expensive, a simple 200 ml water bottle will set you back 3.5 euros and its not easy to buy after security. Security is in layers, you may have to go thru more than 3 different security personnel at 3 different stages. You may think is design to make you lose your flight. The staff deserve a dedicated review web page. Rude does not begin to describe them.  This has been for my wife and small kids a nightmare trip with Turkish airlines, to the point that my wife and I made the promise to never ever go back to this airport no matter how attractive the offer. Once we landed, none of the services was there, imagine 36 minutes in a bus after the flight - of course you miss your flight connection, and then you are left alone in an airport the size of 10 football fields walking cause no trams no nothing, asking people cause all the signs are directing you to nowhere.

Some food outlets which i have visited on the airport (burger king and popeyes) only offers a limited choices of food and they don't offer the full menu. If you are travelling to and from Istanbul city, allow around 2 hours of travel to or from the city because the city gets too much crowded during rush hours.

Istanbul,"Not Verified |  I have transited through Istanbul airport, the new one, twice during my trip to Spain. The airport is really huge and well built. But apart from the queuing time for security check during transit, it has used its massiveness in a positive way. As so many passengers pass through this airport, delays during security check is quite understandable. But the airport is really clean and you can feel that they have gone an extra mile about cleanliness. The duty free is awesome, you can get a flavour of Turkey alongside all the shiny things people love to buy in airports. They have quite a few options of fried chicken and pizza in the food court as well which is situated at the top floor, but my expectation was a bit high on this. The airport has more than enough cafes and bars to take care of your appetite. They also have place for Turkish foods and sweets (kebabs and stuffs). It's a separate place than the food court and a bit hidden. But if you can't find it, don't shy away from asking ""How may I help you"" people about it. Airport stuffs are really helpful and they were almost every corner. They were helpful about everything except flight rescheduling. I suppose they didn't have much information about that. This airport has a lot of places for sitting or sleeping. So, I wouldn't mind taking a good 3-4 hours' layover here. The only problem I faced some of the food places (only a few though) don't accept anything except Turkish Lira and the only currency exchange that I could find, were giving very bad exchange rates.

The airport is beautiful with enormous airy spaces. Unlike the previous airport, you can sign in for free Wifi. When your hour runs out, login again. Only complaints are: 1) we didn't find any airport map kiosks. We had to go to an information booth with questions. Information booth people were very friendly. 2) the long, fabric covered benches were absolutely filthy. Covered in food stains - it's only been a few months. They'll have to recover them with vinyl.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | First of all Turkish Airlines is an airline that most of its customers are transit passengers, and Istanbul Airport, the hub of Turkish Airlines should be more transit-friendly. Most of the shops are high-end shops which an average person would not go in, basic needs such as toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, shower gel, deodorant, snacks are not available in this airport. If you're a transit passenger who has a long layover here you'll have to go to a lounge and if you're not flying Star business or Star Gold then you'll have to use the IGA Lounge for a fee which is 59euros, and to be honest this lounge doesn't even deserve 10euros. Food and beverage selections are poor. Amenities used in the lounge are also low quality. And if you want to buy something for your friends there are duty-free shops everywhere but this duty might be one of the most overpriced duty-free you've ever seen in an airport. I've been to many airports as a frequent traveler but this airport is a really weird airport, to be honest. The airport's design is just fantastic but it feels like it's more like a shopping mall with only clothing stores and duty-free. And on my latest flight thankfully I was flying on a star alliance carrier (Turkish airlines) and used my gold status to use the TK lounge which was beyond my expectations. Of course, the airport can get better, but it needs better management and a lot of time.",4,Arrival and Departure,July 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,4,3,3,3,1,2
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  They have been successful in making it a mall but not an airport sadly! I would rate 1 out of 5. Basic things like charging points, gate screens and free WiFi should be available. Also the lounge points and access were too limited. A place where there are so many flights with layovers. I think basic things should have been taken care off. Indeed a very huge airport but the experience was very sad and tiring. Will not recommend anyone unless they will go explore Istanbul.",2,Transit,July 2019,Couple Leisure,Transit,2,1,2,1,3,N/A,2
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible airport. Apparently it is a silent airport where they don’t have a sign for it. We have missed our flight despite the fact we have checked in 2 hours pre domestic flight only because we thought there’d be an announcement to open or close the gates. They haven't even announced our names. Also it is a lie that the airport is silent as there are announcements for missing kids etc. The internet is rubbish as well. They say this is the best airport, biggest and everything but idiots don’t know big doesn’t get close to being good. For internet you have 1 hour only for which you need to have a mobile phone to get SMS messages and have only couple of hours to use it. So if you are a passenger with a long connection you are screwed. In Dubai, your phone connects without any info needed to be provided to the airport WiFi, you just need to choose it. Also it is super expensive so get ready to pay at least twice high street prices for food.",1,Departure Only,July 2019,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,3,1,1,1,1,1,3

Istanbul,"❎ Not Verified | I flew in on a business trip. Was in awe of size: its immense. On arrivals, no wait at passport control. Breezed right through. Long walk and airport felt 'empty' so walk seemed longer. But as more people use it and it grows to its capacity, I think the crowds will make it feel smaller and less empty. The departure area is where you get to see the true beauty of the airport: 1. Large open plan and huge shopping areas. 2. Lots of people in 'Ask me' outfits to get help from. You need it because of its vast size and you don't want to trust signs and go all the way to realize you should have turned 300M meter back. 3. Business class check in area has its own sofa comfort seating. 4. Access to Star Gold lounge was all through frictionless scanning of boarding pass. 5. An amazing race car track. Here are the things that were things they need to fix and fall below the standard of a world class airport: 1. On arrival in the customs area, there is a set of uniformed officers. Opposite them was a pair of civilians. One in a red polo shirt. He asked me to go for secondary screening. That is not an issue. But why is he standing as a civilian with no visible ID. I asked his colleague who they were to be asking this since I see the uniformed people on the right. She produced her id. This is just plain stupid. I am sure there are reasons that they need to be under cover in civilian clothes for catching bad guys. But when you are standing in official capacity, then produce your id. How is an arriving passenger to know that this is not a cab driver that entered the pick-up area and this is not where the receiving area starts? I have never seen this in the 30 cities in different countries I have traveled in the last year. Istanbul airport: have your plain cloth officers stand next to the uniformed ones and have their badges visible. This is not a secret police state where you expect people arriving to obey you just because you have a red polo shirt on. 2. The wifi process in the lounge was a bit convoluted: you scan your boarding pass and it prints a tag with your 'unique' name and password to access the wifi. I am sure they are doing this for some marketing reasons to tie your name to your laptop address to your wifi. But its painful to use the wifi (enter this 'unique' id, and odd ball password). Why have the frictionless entry on the entrance to lounge if you are going to ask the traveler to slow down and spend extra time entering stuff. 3. Signage for lounges is good when you come down the long terminal walk. But its not easy to see where you are supposed to hang a left for the lounges. Had to ask. The only sign thats there is on a tv display at lower level than where you expect to see it (i.e. the other 45 signs that navigate you to the airport). Seems like somebody missed putting an extra sign to 'hang a left' where you would expect to find it and they short cutted by putting a tv display.""",7,Arrival and Departure,June 2019,Business,Arrival and Departure,5,5,3,5,N/A,2,4

Istanbul,"Not Verified |  The new airport is extremely clean, lots of great shops and amenities. It was not overly loud and definitely quite spacious with lots of lounges to spend my (long) transit of 8h. My one major issue is with the internet. I've yet to see any kind of proper international airport without WiFi access. The only way you can access WiFi at the airport is if you have a Turkish number. If you click on the option to access, even though a full list of country codes pops up, you will not get a message on the number you enter. I was only able to get (limited-period) access by basically asking/begging the Starbucks employee because even the WiFi at Starbucks wasn't working! So while I would otherwise give it a 9, the lack of WiFi meant I had to completely waste my 8h transit twiddling my thumbs.",5,Transit,May 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,4,5,4,N/A,1,4

Shortest was 20 minutes and longest 30 minutes. It does not strike me as an efficient airport at all. When you transit make sure you have enough time between flights. The airport is too big. I walked 2.5 km to get from one gate to the next. I never was able to enjoy the nice looking shops as the delays with taxiing, immigration lines and walking distances are too long.

Nowhere to sit down, food and beverage is repeated, same three restaurants all over the place. Nowhere to charge your phone. On the plus side, you will get good exercise walking the literal miles between gates.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I have travelled through the new Istanbul Airport 6 times in the last two months. This airport is massive, pretentious and soulless- it clearly an ego project, built to show off, rather than being focused on the convenience of the actual persons of importance, namely us, the travelers. The distances in the airport are ridiculous, and the taxiing time of the airplanes are preposterous. Twice we taxi’ed more than 30 minutes after leaving our gate, and all other times more than 15 minutes. 3 of my flights were delayed by close to 30 minutes and 1 by an hour. Twice I nearly missed my connecting flights because of the combination of long taxiing, delays and the 2.5 km run from one gate to another. In fairness, I will list a few redeeming factors: Turkish Airlines Business Lounge is still one of the best lounges, but it is no better than the old one at Atatürk, and has no style. The transfer security is quick, efficient and has a priority lane. Makes up for the rudeness.  All in all, I will avoid this Istanbul monstrosity if and when I can.",3,Transit,June 2019,Business,Transit,3,3,4,3,N/A,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I have passed through the new Istanbul airport twice now. It is big and beautiful but horrible. The focus is on the mall aspects. For travelers it is ridiculous. Very limited public seating. What there is is uncomfortabke and disgustingly dirty (already!). No place to charge a phone. Food options are limited but that is likely tied to next phase of opening. The airport is big so it needs a more efficient way to move between terminals. It took me 80 mins to get from arrival gate, through transfer security, to next gate at 5 in the morning when it was relatively quiet because it is far and because only one security bay was open. My departure gate area had secondary security. On the secure side there was enough seating for about half the passengers and with standing room it was very crowded. There are only two lounges. One for Business/First on Turkish and the other a dismal pay for use that costs 59 euros (with limited options, space, comfort, and facilities). If you have Priority pass, Amex, or access from another airline you are out of luck. One hour of poor wifi, non-extendable.

Istanbul,"Not Verified |  My mother and I had a connection flight via the new Istanbul Airport. During the checks before we were to board the plane, the staff were insulting towards mother. They were asking rather strange questions about her. She was travelling to the UK with me, and I remember hearing the team asking what her intentions for going to the UK are. Once that question was answered, the staff asked about my (The son) occupation from my mother. They continued questioning her by further asking what sort of car I drive in the UK and how long I (The Son) has lived in the UK. The questions and the amount of pressure they put my mother under was very overwhelming. I was left with no choice but to intervene as my mother got so upset with the staff's attitude and cried in front of everyone. We will never travel anywhere via Istanbul again. The staff at the airport, especially the ones at the checkpoint, are super rude and very unprofessional. I can not believe that I have now contributed to their salary by choosing to fly their national airline. The experience has been very disappointing and one that we will not forget for a very long time. I think building a new modern airport is one side of the equation and what is more important is to ensure the airport is supported by well-mannered staff.

Impossible in this newest mall port more concerned with retail revenue that traveller convenience. Walked around on five separate occasions looking for a seat. The few lounge clusters provided are used as beds – so one sleeper takes up 5 seats. And if you do find a seat it will almost certainly be stained by heads and feet. What about charging a phone – no too much to expect in 2019, right. Apparently it is in IGA. There is nowhere, I repeat, nowhere to charge a device in the main terminal hall. So ask for help. The one information desk is appalling. After three attempts to find a charge station I gave up – one person perfunctorily dealt with the a queue while two others sat looking on. Customer service is a concept this airport is yet to grasp. And the internet: one hour timed from opening, not useable in discriminate logins, and you need a contactable phone to use that.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  It took 35 minutes to arrive airport from Maslak CBD by car. Entrance was very quick as the new airport terminal has seven gates and plenty of security screening boots. Since I did my online checkin, I proceed to the passport control and completed procedures and security check in less than two minutes. All those formalities were quite smooth and rapid when it is compared to old Ataturk Airport. The new terminal is spacious and architecturally inspiring. Yet some finishing materials are poorly detailed. It gives the impression that the airport was finished in a rush. Inside there are a large number of duty-free shops offering a wide range of brands & goods. The food court is on the upper floor and accessed by escalators. It seems the area and choices are limited for the large airport. This is little bit annoying. It took 15 minutes walk to go to my gate after passport control. The longest walk I guess would be 25 minutes if your gate is on the extreme corner. Toilets were sufficient and clean, yet the amenities were basic. It requires more efforts to catch the standards in Doha, Dubai or Singapore. What is really missing in this brand new airport is quite corners equipped with more comfortable seating. If you have long connecting time and don't want to pay for the expensive lounges, you would definitely need some quiter corners where you can rest, read or having a quick nap. This is essential for this size international hub.

Check in staff could not help us locate them. Nobody working in duty free shops. My wife wanted to buy some make up and picked up some testers to find staff to help her and were accused of theft. We were then forced to buy these goods. And of course nobody spoke english so we could not understand them and they could not understand us. The bathrooms were dirty with water  sprayed everywhere.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  The new Istanbul airport is a glorious Chaos in all fairness! This review is based on the multiple transits I have had through the new Istanbul Airport during the past month (April-May 2019).  It is a grand modern structure which has a lot of potential to be a good airport in future. It was a complete compromise from the word go. Chaotic, messy, unplanned. Mismanagement and lack of planning visible all around. Sub standard materials, furnishing and fittings are used in quite a lot of places which has started wearing off and breaking apart already. There was deficiency of seating areas, toilets, waiting spaces, charging stations, trained personnel, directional guidance, food options and mobility assistance. While the fact remains that it's a new airport which is still evolving and improving, there are quite a lot of basic facilities which are lacking. Hence, the overall experience was BAD! Untrained staff with a rude attitude was standard and consistent throughout the airport with very few exceptions. Most couldn't speak English (Without holding that against the staff, it is crucial for an international Airport which deals with majority passengers from non Turkish speaking countries to have bilingual staff who could converse and guide the passengers/customers effectively in English and/or other prominent foreign languages. Many staff were unruly with their uniforms and manners too. Most were busy on their phones and didn't care much about their work and the passengers. Beyond the visible language barrier, there was a prominent sense of unwillingness to help too in spite of approaching and enquiring with them which added to the overall bad experience. Internet connectivity is quite the joke! There is no wifi internet connectivity anywhere in the airport. And this scenario exists in 2019 in a brand new international Airport which is claiming to be among the best airports in the world. There seems to be a guest network which doesn't work. And some passengers have claimed to have accessed it, but with a time limit of 1 hour. After that the wifi apparently gets blocked and could not be used from the same devise again. In my case, I couldn't even get it started which was the case with most airport users. This is not a pedestrian friendly airport. It's massive in size with no or little mobility assistance. To put it into perspective, it took me 25 minutes of brisk walking to reach my gate with no train lines or any other mode of assistance available anywhere around. Have also heard stories of passengers being demanded money for taking them on airport buggies. Haven't experiences it personally and hence won't comment. There seems to be little thought and planning which went into designing mobility and accessibility for disabled passengers too. Food and refreshments : There are quite a few cafes opened through out the airport (very few near to many boarding gates though). But there's a lack of choice when it comes to proper restaurants. It's mostly fast food joints which are in offer. This is an airport with good potential to do it right. In it's current form, it's in a sad state though. Haven't intentionally mentioned about none of the lounge programs (PriorityPass, Loungekey, Dragon Pass or any other) being accepted in any of the airport Lounges. The only option is to pay $59 p.p for the access at present.",3,Transit,May 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,1,3,2,3,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | You need to walk through long corridors and the distance to the right gates seems endless. Too few toilets, which seems quite weird for a new terminal. Some of them were already out of service! Amazing: there are nearly no seats in some areas! No ATMs and no banks. You only have some exchange bureaux with poor rates. Extortionate prices at the restaurant and bars. To use the airport WIFI, you need a Turkish SIM card. This one is very funny!

From upstairs I saw dirty tops of kiosks and other surfaces. And toilets. Toilets were awful. You have to check how it works in Zurich Airport, because there were cleanest restrooms I've ever seen.

It takes forever to get from check-in to the gate, and when we arrived back in Istanbul, we taxi'ed forever. And then had to board a bus on top of that. I can't imagine having to take a connecting flight. This airport doesn't compete with the other big international airports. There is actually paid buggy service, which will take you from one terminal/gate to another (which TK is now offering a discount for to members). If a paid service is available, then surely there it is known how far apart everything is, and there should be a free efficient way to get between terminals/gates.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | Were concerned that we might miss our connecting flight as our Turkish Airline flight from Manchester was about 90 minutes late. Took about 22 minutes to taxi to arrival gate, 15 minutes to walk to the Domestic airport and about 5 minutes to our departure gate. Our flight to Antalya was also running late so we were able to catch this. Some people have stated that it took them up to 1 hour to walk between International arrivals and the domestic departure terminals. We can understand this, as this airport is so huge it all depends which gate you arrive at. Our departure flight with British Airways went smoothly, their check in desk was close to entrance gate 7 and the walk to the departure gate took about 15 minutes. There are some ""teething"" problems like the long taxi time to the runways but once these are sorted it will be one of the world's top airports.",8,Arrival and Departure,March 2019,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,4,4,3,4,N/A,3

To get to the connecting flight, I had to walk a long distance to the other end of the airport.",2,Transit,April 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,1,1,2,2,1,1
Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified | Nothing is streamlined at this airport. The staff and customer relations are extremely rude and very difficult getting any answer if you don’t speak Turkish. Good luck if you want to get a tax refund. They insist on seeing all your items. There was a line of people with their luggage open trying to find their items. There is very little seating and frustrating trying to get answers.,1,Departure Only,May 2019,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,3,1,1,2,3,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Did I go to same airport as the previous reviewers? Istanbul Airport is a dramatic improvement over Atatürk Airport. Istanbul Airport has everything that Atatürk was lacking. Plenty of eating options, plenty of shopping options, plenty of places to sit, plenty of (though for a few) luggage carts, and plenty of flight information screens. WiFi is limited only if you have the airport app if you can figure how it works. The airport is huge but is logically designed and easy to get around. The Turkish Airlines and airport app do have maps of the airport. Just as in Atatürk passengers from the US don’t have to go through a security check with regards to connecting to their onward flight and can go straight to the terminal. But even going through the security check did not take long as the lines were short at least at 9:00 am. If you have a connection of 75 minutes or less you can take a short cut though I didn’t see any visible signs. Yes it did take time for the plane to taxi for take off and landing but it was no more than 15-20 minutes similar to CDG. The app can certainly be improved, the buggies could be free instead of charged, and there should be information desks in each pier. But overall a good first experience at Istanbul Airport.",9,Transit,May 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,5,5,5,5,1,4
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Really bad airport. Most of the transit desks not open. Wifi does not work, I tried about 10 times to get a confirmation SMS. Staff not helpful - I got answers, ""wifi does not work, you need to buy a Turkish sim card"" or ""verification only works with Turkish sim card"". Come on - I will not buy a card just for transit and why not just open wifi without complicated verification as airports up to international standard have? Just a poor airport.",1,Transit,May 2019,Business,Transit,4,N/A,2,0,3,N/A,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | This airport is a shocker, I appreciate it is new and still finding it's feet but most of these complaints are fundamental design or money grab issues 1. Runways are miles from gates, of my 4 trips, 3 took 25-30 mins taxiing time 2. In most cases no air-bridge, you have to climb on a bus from the gate and walk up the steps outside, like a regional airport. Even the shuttle ride was a good 10 mins! 3. No free Wifi. But it is available for the TA or IGA lounge patrons (one shop said they’d give me the password if I bought lots of stuff) 4. Have to pay 1 euro for trolley rental, with a long queue at the vending machine. You can get it refunded if you walk about 1km to the return point but who has the time? 5. Approx. 1 hr trip to Istanbul centre on a good day. No fast rail yet, choice is public bus or taxi. Beware if there is traffic congestion on the freeway (I had a 5km long jam inbound one time) 6. Food vendors expensive. 40TL for an ice cream and the staff I engaged spoke only Turkish and were rude when I couldn't understand them. 7. Departure hall immense. No support for people with mobility issues. There are motorised wheelchairs running around like in Singapore but they tried to charge $20US. It's ok for the well heeled if you pay 59 euro to enter the IGA lounge then can get a buggy to the gate. 8. Not enough seating in the departure lounge, people were lying on the floor 9. Signage poor, people were wandering about looking for Turkish Business class checkin. Even staff weren’t sure 10. Despite being open only 1 month, some parts like toilets were looking filthy with tiles loose in places. falling apart already! 11. There were staff standing in some places to direct which was nice, but not where it is needed, eg passport control at transfer was absolute chaos, huge queues, no one knew where to line up and 30 min wait, people pushing in, one woman was screaming. On a positive note the architecture, especially the roof design is quite nice.",2,Arrival and Departure,April 2019,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,2,1,2,2,1,1
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with this airport in April and May for a holiday with my partner. When we heard that we were going to the new airport, we were very excited at first, but found out later this is merely a piece of over-selling hype that, in no way, can compete with other neighbour international airports. The average taxing time is 30 minute. You did not see it wrong. If you want to feel what does it look like driving on ground, on an aircraft, come to this airport. The infrastructure of this airport is poorly designed. The toilets are extremely sparse and it seems the builder has forgotten to build three times more toilets in the airport. You need to walk with extremely long distance in order to get through check-in desk, security, and gate. The staffs here are poorly trained. Most of them can only speak with basic English. For those who know some English, they don't know how to say it politely: when we arrived to this airport by a 5-hour delayed flight, the Turkish Airlines desk in this airport, which are with the most unhelpful staffs I have ever seen from my experience of travelling more than 40 countries, shouted at me like I am a low-class citizen. In summary, avoid this international hub at all cost. It is just pure fantasy constructed by politicians and builders who know nothing about efficiency. Nearby airport such as Dubai or Sabiha Gokcen airport are much better in all regards. If the lowest score I can give to an airport is -inf, Istanbul airport is definitely well deserved of this score.",1,Arrival and Departure,May 2019,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,2,1,1,N/A,1,1
Istanbul,"Not Verified |  It is basically a luxury cruise ship both from inside and outside but with very small engines to serve. Think about China and UK, both have massive airports with train/metro transition which serves every 3 minutes, but in Istanbul you have to walk for at least 3 hours and mine took 3 hours 15 minutes walk between two points. Yes it is massive, it seems glorious when you look at it but it is not functional certainly until Istanbul airport management builds train transportation for every 3 to 5 minutes that goes to all the gates from the main entrance.",2,Transit,April 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,3,3,2,2,4,4
Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | This airport is a disaster particularly when compared to the old (sic), wonderfully functional Istanbul Ataturk. The ground use plan is a disaster. The terminal is in the wrong place relative to the runways and the taxiway system is a joke. One wonders if the people who designed the airport did traffic movement simulation studies. Given the lengthy aircraft taxi distances and structural bottlenecks they do not have a snowball's chance in hell of even coming close to their traffic projections. The airport is surrounded by high terrain and is subject to blowing sand. THY aircraft have to be fitted with engine protection covers when parked. When we used the airport there was also thick ground mist. Signage is appalling. Distances within the terminal are unacceptably long. Apart from high end shops orientated towards the super rich the commercial offer is worse than Ataturk, paricularly food-wise. On departure the only hot drink we could get was tea from a barrow boy near the gate. There was no coffee. The squeamish should avoid going anywhere near the toilets. Sadly, THY and TGS service standards have slipped beyond recognition. Maybe their best staff chose not to make the move. Check in line was much longer than anything I saw during six years of regular trips to and from Ataturk.

Kids “play area” is a couple of broken old arcade games (not functioning) and some ikea tables and chairs. Lots of delays coming in and out of this airport (as there used to be at Ataturk); if you have a connection of an hour or less, you won’t make it.

I had so many choices on cafés, shops, etc. Staff were mostly helpful but there could be an improvement on the friendliness.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bigger isn't always better. I had a transit with Turkish airline between an international flight and a domestic one. We had to walk so far to get to the passport immigration it was ridiculous! Once we finally got there we chose the ""other nationalities"" section. It was chaotic. There weren't many people but the queuing bands weren't properly laid out and it was difficult to know where to go. We went to an empty booth with four police woman there and they told us it was closed! There was no sign or anything there. They were incredibly rude! We then went to another booth and that one was open but you couldn't tell! There wasn't any sign or anything! After passport control we ended up at the baggage claim! Even tho we had a connecting domestic flight! There weren't any clear signs that this passport control was only for baggage claim and not for connecting passengers! We had to go exit baggage claim and run back up to departures again. The escalators are only on the sides so we had to make a dash for them. Once upstairs we went back through security and at least that was quick. Once in the departure terminal there was nothing to eat and everything was far apart. A few cafe's, a burger king and a pizza place. Very inconvenient after we found out of our 45 minutes delay with Turkish Airlines. The bathrooms weren't very clean either. There was still construction dust on them. There were only 3 urinals per bathroom for a big are! I guess they thought since there barely was anywhere to eat or drink people wouldn't use the bathroom! The airport is beautiful but there aren't enough signs and things are too far apart. Ataturk airport was much better it was conveniently located, and there was a decent food court in domestic terminal. This is a major downgrade and I'll have to rethink about transiting through Istanbul now.",4,Transit,April 2019,Business,Transit,4,4,1,1,2,3,2

Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified | The arrival to the airport went well but the departure experience was extremely awful.

Istanbul,✅ Trip Verified |  I am obliged to write this review about your boarding posts policies as it should be taken seriously.

Especially Turkish business airline lounge which the staff turned away people with business class tickets printing specifically ‘You are invited to the Turkish Airline Lounge’. We made the correction with their staff after being turned away, but was met with rudeness and no apologies. Along the way, staff raised their voices at passengers.

Both times that we flew through IST we landed on time and then it took us another 30-35 minutes to arrive to the gate and get off the plane. Then you have to run madly all the way from one side of the airport to the other to catch you flight. By the grace of God we made it, but it was a terrible experience.

Domestic departures terminal still under construction as the restaurants (Burger Kings and Popeyes still not open although lights and menu are displayed) 'Taxiing' - Time from landing / Taking off from/to Terminal building The first 2 flights we took we had an average taxi time of 25 mins (1 flight with LO and the other with TK) On the Turkish flight we arrived at an 'international' gate and were bussed to the terminal (Journey was average time - but the bus had seen better days! The last flight we had a taxi time of 35mins as we waited for another plane to land on the runway we were going to depart from (although they boast about having 4 runways!) Arrivals - Baggage Although we were not the first off the plane - we still waited 40mins+ for bags to be delivered at the carousel! Airport WiFi is a shambles - first you have to enter your phone number and wait for a code by text message which sometimes doesn't arrive - even after multiple attempts Once you are connected the speed is shockingly slow and decides to log you out after 10mins. The terminal is clean, there are lots of staff wearing 'ask me for help' and the toilets were clean. Seating area is few and far between and some people actually lay on the floor as there wasn't enough general seats (most seats were in the 'closed off' gates We took a taxi (both ways) to and from the city and it took about an 1hour All in all; there were more negative than positive of using this airport - its a nice shiny brand new airport that is very inconvenient and not-traveler friendly.",2,Arrival and Departure,April 2019,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,5,1,2,1,5

This continued for 3 hours when I decided to go to the departure part of the airport. There are no place to comfortably wait for your flight. People are sleeping on the carpets in the middle of food courts. The benches are already broken and people working here are not friendly at all. The food is served cold at several food places.

Free Wifi is only limited to 2 hours. In addition to all of these, no tap water sources to drink some water. Markets and cafes are crazy expensive. It is massive; however, it is massive in prices too. Moreover; this airport doesn't have enough sitting space in the main hall despite its massive space. People were sleeping on the floors. There is no metro connection to city; shuttle buses are expensive too. My main problem is with white lights that they used in the terminal lightning; why didn't they choose warm lights which close to the real sunlight?  I found queues less, security check was finished in a minute. Because of I am a transit passenger I dont know check in area.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified |  A beautiful Airport. Cons: Prior to passport control: Only 1 small cafe with 10 chairs, no assistance for early bag drop off. 1 hour away from Istanbul Ataturk Airport City with only a bus service. The bus service is done by a coach and a standard bus service. The coaches sometimes do not stop at specified locations, so you will need to make sure you leave early otherwise you might miss your flight. Airport is too big that involves a lot of walking with few aids to speed up reaching your gate. Amenities: No water dispensers, wifi requiring sim card to receive text which contains password, slow wifi. Food court is hidden away, the vendors are short staffed and do not have enough supply which means most of the food is not available. Food price is extortionate. Queue times are long in excess of 20 minutes with waiting times for food in excess of 15 minutes. This is very impractical and it was not even lunch time. Unnecessary number of security checks: upon entering the airport a body and baggage scan. Then at baggage drop off 2 separate confirmation checks that you are supposed to be flying. Then again at passport control full body scan with baggage scan. Then at the gate, 3 confirmation checks that you are supposed to be on the flight with another body and baggage check involving drug swabs. The security is unnecessary, just check properly at passport control and then let the passengers relax. Insufficient gate chairs resulting in over half the planes passengers standing, so I advise you either get a seat early or arrive late. Also once you enter the gate area, you are not allowed to leave. No water dispenser or toilet facilities.

They didn’t even offer her to sit down, when we waited for a car to pick her up. They just laughed when we kept telling them she needed a wheelchair and then they said that we were rude. They kept us without the possibility of getting something to drink or to go to the bathroom for two hours after getting of our plane. This is how they treat an elderly woman who is exhausted, in pain and dehydrated. They also split up families as only one can accompany a person who needs assistance. Even if they were just to walk and not going in a car. I have experienced rudeness and incompetence in other places but never both at the same time in such a degree. And it wasn’t only us.

It took us about 50 minutes to finally get through, and into the baggage reclaim area; our cases must have by then done about 20 circuits on the conveyor belt. The Metro had by then shut down for the night, so we joined the queue for the taxi. Queue is maybe a misrepresentation as various people tried to push in, even though there were barriers along the queue. We eventually got to the front, and it was a complete shambles, with drivers touting for business, and people shouting.

If you think it's acceptable to gesture and grunt at passengers, don't be cocky when you're treated that way in return. Ground staff are aggressive and dismissive. Connections for some flights are 20-minute shuttles away, with no consideration of disembarking time, security, or boarding times - they just say ""hurry up"".

Dubai,"Not Verified |  My wife and I were returning from Bologna to Singapore. As we were traveling through Emirates , we had to transit in Dubai. We got down from the plane and were herded into a bus. As we alighted from the bus, we walked to the Flight Connections marked in Red. We were then led to the security check and we chose to go to the extreme left lane . At the conveyor belt, the security officers started shouting at the passengers to remove the watches, belts and anything that was metal. That is fair enough as I understand that it is to not slow down the metal detector screening. I complied with their instructions. At the Conveyor belt, there was security officer who told us to put all our belongings into the tray and then put it into the conveyor belt. My cabin luggage was too large to fit into the tray and I had put in on the conveyor belt. This is similar to what we do in all airports including Singapore Changi. Then this security officer started shouting at me. My wife was treated even worse, she went into the metal detector and then was told to return and put her shoes into the conveyor belt. Only that there was no tray for her to put it in. So she asked the same security officer if there was a tray available . The security officer shouted at her and said ""JUST PUT IT IN A TRAY"" My wife had no choice but to put it in the same tray as my cabin bag which was already jutting out from the tray. Very unhygienic but we had to comply. My wife and I were furious with this security officer and we approached another security officer wearing a jacket . He was standing past the metal detector. He told us that he registered our complaint and speak to the officer involved. When I returned to Singapore on the 16/09/24, I decided to write to Dubai Airport Customer Service to give a feedback on this incident. However, I was met with an even worse encounter. When I wrote about this incident to the Dubai Customer Service, I had given them my name, the location, the lane, the description of the officer in question and the description of the security supervisor. They then wanted me to give my passport, my boarding pass, a picture of what I was wearing on that day and provide again the location of the incident that happened. When I asked them, they said that Dubai Airport Police required it. I told them that their demands were unwarranted and it felt as if I was being investigated instead of the officer in question. They then told me in their own words, ""Without providing the required details we will assume you no longer interested in this complaint and we will be closing the case from our end."" I am flabbergasted by this kind of attitude. They treat us like cattle and have no regard for their visitors to Dubai. They just don't care and you reach out to them to give a feedback, they treat you like a criminal. This would have been easily resolved if they actually saw their own CCTV, went back to the day and location of the incident. Then talk to the security supervisor whom we had talked to, then counsel the security officer not to treat the airport visitors like this. I advise any visitors coming to this seeming First World Airport to receive a Third World treatment. Just downgrade your expectations.",1,Departure Only,September 2024,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,3,N/A,3,0,N/A,2,1
Dubai,"Not Verified | Disappointed with Dubai airport (and with Emirates airlines in general, but this is a side issue). Killing time as a transit passenger at DXB is far from pleasant. Shops are uninviting, and the goods for sale are mostly tacky stuff such as golden Rolex watches or top brand whiskey. Generally, if you are not the type that wears heavy gold chains and huge emerald rings - you've got nothing to look for at this airport. If you think, then, that instead of shopping you could just relax with a cup of coffee and a snack, you're up for a nasty surprise - the prices are a complete rip-off. With so many shops offering drinks you might imagine that you, as the customer, would enjoy the benefit of the competition. Alas, this is not the case. Prices are astronomical at ALL coffee places. So uniform, actually, that they seem dictated from above. I know coffee and snack prices are always high at airports, I have experienced Zurich. But Dubai airport's prices are hard to believe. Finally I must add, that if you cancel a purchase at a Dubai airport shop and they say ""No problem, Sir, we'll refund the purchase price to your credit card"" - don't believe them. They gave me some coupon that looked like a proof of refund, but nothing has been refunded to my credit card. I guess they think ""Hey, is this guy going to fly back to Dubai and sue us?"", and they are right, I won't.",1,Transit,July 2024,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,3,4,1,1,2,4

Dubai,"Not Verified |   Same experience as previously in regards to woefully inadequate seating for the huge number of passengers during lay over (and very anatomically uncomfortable loungers IF available, which is highly unlikely). Even more remarkable the totally minuscule amount of toilets (applies to both male and female ones) in Terminal 3 and the resulting huge queues. Hardly any cafes and poor quality cheap fast food types only, no customer care, airport taxi service passing passengers way to close for comfort in the terminal and generally the most boring, uninviting, minimally functioning airport facility with no aspiration to be anything other than basic, cold, and lacking in style, creativity, customer service or thought into making the experience an enjoyable one. Poor signage of locations of lounges for members of certain airlines Food/ beverage prices astronomical and totally unjustified. Aall in all an airport best to bypass .",1,Transit,July 2024,Couple Leisure,Transit,3,1,1,1,2,2,1
Dubai,"Not Verified | I'm surprised by all the negative reviews as I found Dubai clean, efficient and well signed, with plenty of seating offering runway views. (I was using T3, which might explain it.) The airport seemed to operate more efficiently than I remember from a few years ago. My one gripe would be that the electronic passport gates on arrival rejected my passport because it was the first time I'd used it there, which seems to be a common occurrence. I was selected for extra security on departure, with multiple swabs, which made me nervous. But everyone was courteous.

Dubai,"Not Verified |   Stopped here on the way back from Poland for a 22 hr stopover before flying to Australia, everything was ok until you buy something to eat. Two cookies and 1 small drink $35 Australian dollars, 2 croissants $24 Australian, if they think that they are doing travelers a favor by supplying food at these absolutely ridiculous prices all I can say travelers bring your own food and drinks, these people are criminals charging these prices, from now on I will be flying Qatar Airways and I travel a lot to Dubai but never have complained about the price gouging. If you plan on staying the night try $400 a night for a basic room with a 3 star rating, or you could do what a lot of travelers do that can’t afford to spend $400 a night at the overpriced hotel and that is to sleep on the lounges that are spread around the airport. Even if you wanted to sit on these lounges you can’t because they are all full of people who sleep on them .

Arrived at Dubai airport on the 19th morning, as of today after 3 days of being me hostage at Dubai airport (Terrorists would have treated any hostage better - there's no information from Dubai airport staff on anything, no worry about my dietary needs, my medical needs, sorry about my personal & business plan). Dubai Airport staff directed me and others to continuously watch out for the Gate number on the screen as the flight would be listed there (but they won't tell when), I and others kept waiting for hours for the flight to appear, they appear without gates, stay listed there and then gets canceled. I am now on airport for more than 36 hours, no hotel provided, no vegetarian food available, I now almost three days in the same pair of clothing, and my medication & other essentials are in a checked-in bag that Emirates staff don't even care and tell me anything on when it will be returned to me.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified |  Instead of being responsible and cancelling all flights, they decided to pretend everything was fine. The real situation is no one knows what the status of any flight is or where checkin desks will be for specific airlines. No staff at the airport had any information.

Booking a hotel another fun experience with the shuttle service, the area shuttles are not identified noone helps to point out where your shuttle should be at, holiday Inn seems to be the only consistent shuttle.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been coming to Georgia for 4 years. It’s a place a love visiting. I am African. The first year I visited Tbilisi international airport I had no issue at immigration, the staff were so friendly and I felt so welcomed! I was even greeted with a bottle of wine! No complaints! Sadly as the years have gone by I have noticed the treatment of people who are non Europeans is very different from European/Caucasian passengers at immigration. The second year I came with my friend and we were interrogated like there was no tomorrow! Why are you coming here? What is in your bag? We had everything scanned! And I believe it was purely because he (Caucasian) was with me (African). The third year the same thing I came with my girlfriend (European) and we were both stopped! And interrogated again. Making you feel like a criminal. I saw countless Europeans walk and stroll through. The 4th year I was greeted by immigration with so much attitude, I provided all documents needed, she asked me if it’s my 1st time in Georgia I said no it’s my 4th time. She immediately closed my Passport and said “well if it’s your 4th time you should know you should go to that room”. Now at immigration is a secondary room where there were three officers who asked me where I’m going where I’m coming from and let me go. Back to immigration to see another immigration officer to do exactly what I was doing in the 1st place. The attitude and rudeness of the 1st immigration officer was horrendous. Over the years I have seen that Non Europeans are all told to go to that room. I have seen them (African, Asians, all non Europeans) lining being interrogated and harassed regards-less if you have all documents needed. Sadly to come to Georgia I have to experience this more and more over the years… I think this will be the last time I come here. It’s really sad because the people in Gudauri are so friendly and welcoming, you just have to get through the terrible immigration to experience the nice locals.

Then after a stringent security check on departure from Bangkok, you land in Dubai and to get through connections another security check, even tough you’ve literally just walked off the aeroplane and have t left the airport!! Then a grim check in line to catch your flight and you think hey we’re boarding. No. They’re just sending you downstairs to another waiting area and another security check. This is my second and last trip via Dubai. It may look good but it’s the experience that counts. This is my worst in 28 years of international travel.

Dubai,"Not Verified | Dubai airport is vast, but on entering arrivals staff were to hand explaining exactly where to go. However, the passport scanning system is not very good, neither the biometric system. I inserted my passport, followed instructions and got through customs with no problem. However, my husband had a huge problem. Firstly, the passport scan did not work, then he was sent to have his passport checked by an official and he kept being told to open his eyes for the scanning system. His eyes were wide open and still it did not work. He was then sent quite a way from me to immigration which was unnerving for me since we had never been to Dubai before and I was worried that we would lose each other. Another scan that did not work. Eventually, a phone was used to take his photograph and we were allowed through. A very unpleasant experience for our first impression of Dubai. However, I found terminal 3 to be extremely clean: including toilets on both arrival and departure and food was reasonably priced. I do agree that some airport staff should make passengers more welcome. They are the first point of contact in Dubai and after long journeys they need to be aware of the stress of travel and the apprehension some feel on visiting a different country.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall, my journey through the airport has been smooth. And staying in the Airport for 10 hours overnight is tiring but likely there are some lie-flat seats in the terminal which I found quite useful. The main point that I would talk about is the lavatory problem. I found the lavatory in Concourse A had been ill-maintained. The water sink has been slightly over pressured. When I place my hand on it, some water spills on my T-shirt. That is also why there are lots of water spots on the sink table. Plus I  see some tissues on the sink. I find the Concourse C lavatories are doing a much better job in interior Decoration, and cleanliness. If they can, why they don't do the same for Concourse A?  For transit hubs, this detail does make a lot of difference in user satisfaction and they should invest more in maintaining the quality of the airport facilities quality.",6,Transit,July 2023,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,4,4,3,3,4,5

When you arrive at DBX forty minutes before your next one is due to leave when it should have been two hours and then have to hike almost it seems right the way across the airport to your London flight it's when you ask ""which idiot designed an airport which is going to be mainly used by transit passengers and don't put in travelators"". Fair enough, there were Emirates staff showing which way to go, and it was 'OK' on my return trip but it was still painful.

Dubai,✅ Trip Verified |  I had a lay over of ten hours at Dubai airport. The airline had arranged for my transit visa and hotel stay. There was disorganisation on every process. The immigration official was very rude and refused to communicate with me! Haven’t these people given training as to how friendly they need to be with passengers. My passport was scanned but the machine failed to scan my wife’s passport. There was an official nearby and my wife asked what could be done to get her passport scanned. The lady looked at my wife as if she had asked her the favour of letting her out without a visa. Finally she said “I don’t know”! We realised that there were more whose passports could not be scanned. Now we found another official who directed us to place that resembled a cattle shed and the passports were manually scanned. The instruction signs inside are very poor and some are even misleading. We walked kilometres and after a couple of enquiries reached bus pick up point.

He literally tossed one of my bags onto the conveyer until I told her there are fragile items inside (which she did not ask me while printing out my air ticket) and please handle with care. She then did not toss my second bag.  The security process was also hideous and rudely asked me a few questions when checking the passport. I wanted to buy some food after all the issues at the check in and security area; however, there was a lack of seats and I had to stand up in one of corners and eat. This is quite awful.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified |  Connecting flight was initially delayed by two hours which actually helped as the 1.5hr layover would been close to impossible otherwise with the additional security screening. Our issues started as soon as we arrived at our departure gate. The staff were walking around checking passengers PCR test certificates, some were asking for paper copies, others were asking for electronic copies and they all seemed unaware of what the various different certificates actually looked like from the countries of the different nationalities who were all waiting. There didn’t seem to be any system of checking and it seemed like staff were just asking random people then ignoring others seated next to them. At some point one of the staff shouted something in what sounded like Arabic to the people sitting waiting and then there was a sudden rush of people all trying to start a line to queue then everyone else started reacting to the rush and we had a huge scrum of people all confused and agitated. Staff reacted the this sudden chaos by shouting that boarding wasn’t starting yet, as this was happening someone else came over the PA and started announcing boarding for first class, business class and emirates skywards passengers. We walked to the desk and the agent got very agitated and shouted at us “no, we only ask for first class and business class now” when I said the person next to him had announced boarded had started he glared at us shook his head and said “fine, you can go but you will wait a very long time and the bus is very hot, go, go through and wait” no idea why he was so annoyed but we went through as at least it got us away from the shouting and scrum of people at the desk.

On many occasions I have observed that the service is offered only to passengers selected by the staff and their supervisors, but not to senior citizens and the denial is done in a very rude manner, on the pretext that the services are reserved for VIPs.

Dubai,✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai airport and Emirates terminal is the worst in the business. Inefficiency is appalling and queue management is terrible. People who come 3 hours early to check in for their flight are being penalised because people who are way behind us in the queue gets called forward for their flight even though they arrived late to the airport. So next time we should just come 1 hour to the airport for check-in so that I can just cut the whole queue. Where is the fairness in this? Service from airport and Emirates staff is terrible too. No service at all and no sense of urgency. Dubai should be embarrassed by their airport and airlines.,1,Departure Only,March 2022,Family Leisure,Departure Only,2,N/A,1,1,N/A,2,1
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been traveling since I was 6 or so. I loved Emirates and the airport. Last time I travelled was a few days ago after 5 years. Dubai airport has become the world's worst airport. The way they treat you, so rude.  No customer service. Look down on you. No respect at all.  They will not smile even if you do.

Dubai,"Not Verified |  Worst experience at an airport by far.  The day we land, the man who checked us in through customs. First took my picture, gave me my things back everyone else’s was getting done next, then he rudely asks me to take my contacts out. Now one thing I’m not, is dumb. We have been flying for over 10 hours, touching things, and are exhausted. I politely ask why, and he proceeds to say, because he can not tell that it is me. First of all, you’re lying the camera is called face recognition, whether I have my contacts or glasses on. As I politely told him, my hands not only are dirty, but I have no way of taking them out while in a line with no contact solution. As he proceeds to try to degrade me, laughing with his workers and speaking in Arabic, he then tells me with a smirk, well then you can “go” as in get back on the plane and return to my country.  That’s not the best experience we had. It gets better. As it’s now time to leave Dubai, we were NOW told our Covid tests weren’t valid, and to return to the states it has to be within 24 hours, not 72 hours….oh how lovely. Now we have to pay again for a Covid test, and when we all proceed to get our Covid tests, they called all of our names wrong, some by our last name. Some by their middle names, and or just whatever they wanted. The man who did my mothers tests, calls out our last name - gives her, the paper and passport. We all proceed to walk off. However the mistake we made was not confirm what they handed us was correct. We get to the gate, and my mothers passport was wrong, it was another woman with the same ethnicity, and had a last name very similar to ours. Her last name was Just longer but contained our last name in hers. Now we are pressing for time. My mom gets back to the testing site and the man rudely tells my mother “ I told you to check”. Now correct me if I am wrong, but as a NURSE and or someone who works in the medical field, aren’t you also the one whom is to correct and or make sure information given is correct? Then the woman who’s passport was given incorrectly too my mother was about to put an alert out, stating my mom stole it. This just was a trip from hell. How can someone steal something that can’t just be picked up, by anyone. It has to manually be handed to you, by a worker of the airport assigned to the Covid testing areas. If anyone was to ask me my experience, and or would I be back.  I would kindly tell others choose a different country for sure.",3,Arrival and Departure,February 2022,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,1,1
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified |  New covid procedures are horrendous here. Checking PCR printouts prior to boarding the train, causing huge bottleneck with pushing in and no social distancing. 10-15m walk to the covid testing area, in huge crowds to get to really long queue for covid testing.

To start they check the PCR test documents before entering the train service, causing a huge bottleneck with no social distancing and 100% doing more damage than good! PCR checks were done to board the plane, so this process is ridiculous. After the train then, you need to walk ~100-200m to the covid testing area. Huge queues, under staffed with people pushing in throughout and no real care or control, especially over then family/elderly queue where there are many single men there.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff at Dubai Airport is forcing passengers in transit to retest for Covid. All counties have some requirement of hours that you should undertake Covid Test before taking your first flight. This time limit is related to your first flight and not your arrival at the destination. Dubai airport staff force you to retake Covid Test citing wrong calculation of hours as they calculate it from the time you had your test to the time of arrival at destination. Resultantly you miss your flight. I missed my Kuwait Airlines flight. I know of others also who were forced to undertake Covid Test at Dubai Airport unnecessarily. I request the concerned authorities to please intervene and ask them not to cause this trouble to passengers in transit. Principally speaking, it is the airport where you board your first flight that should check your Covid Test against the requirement of destination country, and not the transit airport. What if in transit, Covid result of a passenger is positive. What will they do? Send him back? Retain him for treatment? Still allow him to proceed? I am stressed that I have to pass through Dubai airport again on my return travel, but I will definitely try and avoid Dubai Airport in future.",1,Transit,November 2020,Family Leisure,Transit,2,2,2,2,1,2,1
Dubai,"Not Verified |  Emirates has been my favorite airline for decades. At Dubai airport the departures and arrivals from Chennai are not connected to the gate by aerobridge. The points to note: 1) During these Covid times bus travel is dangerous, since social distancing can not be maintained. This bus travel is not short also. 2) When the flight services have not resumed 100% why operate a gate without aerobridge facility. 3) You walk through Duty Free, buy items that add to hand luggage and alas you find out you have climb the flight of stairs. 4) It is an arduous task for the old and weak people to climb the stairs.

He very kindly made some phone calls With no luck. Finally he drove me back to security and my iPad was safe and sound with the security personnel. The driver then drove me back to my flight on gate 30 and I made my flight with only a few minutes to go.

It is now one hour and 20 mins after landing, I am still in the baggage hall which is ankle deep in water, roofs are collapsing, there is live electrical equipment in puddles and no one can tell us what is going on. In fact there has been absolutely no communication or action by the staff except to protect stock in the shops. There are three dry belts 6-8 but they are not in use.

Arrival was crowded and people were efficiently handled by the staff. Departure was fine and immigration process easy, however my wife was stopped by police official as during screening a duct tape was found in her purse, so very rudely she was shouted to stand aside and then her bag was opened and tape removed. It was a mistake by my wife but attitude of police was harsh, bad and disgusting. No one should be allowed to shout at ladies.

Dubai,"Not Verified | I have never had a single major issue with Dubai airport. One time when I arrived late I missed my connecting flight. Emirates had lots of staff waiting with new tickets at the ready, they had even already emailed me and text me my new flight information. I was also given some vouchers to use for food. A lot of people complain about the size of the airport and yes it is huge but if my mum at 70 (a 1st time ever long haul traveler) can find her way around terminal 3 A B and C then anyone can. Just ask someone if lost! All you have to do at the end of the day for most of it is walk in a perfectly straight line from one to the other and were required get a 2 min train journey to or from A then up or down the huge lifts you'd have to be blind to not see and your very nearly done. I have to admit I hate the 1hr turn around times on some flights to/from Sydney leaving very little time for anything to go wrong if its a delayed arrival etc but I tend to not bother with these ones anymore and go with another flight that gives me a good few hours stop. I am very lucky to have been a gold member with Emirates for some years now so I can not complain about anything Dubai has to offer in any of their lounges I am allowed to use - always have been fantastic in my opinion.",9,Transit,December 2018,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,4,4,5,4,3,4
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. My trip CGK-DXB-AMS. Arriving from Jakarta on EK357, arrived at 23.00. Aircraft parked at remote stand. Transportation by bus to terminal A. The bus itself is great. After a 15-20minutes bus ride, we arrived at the terminal, I followed sign ""connection"", went thru security. No queue, smooth. Okay, usually will find out a departing gate for the next flight. Flat screens show connecting flights, guess what? Only Emirates flights are shown on these screens? Nowhere, but really nowhere connecting information can be found about other airlines. Many yellow shirt staff with Information to be seen. I asked where to find KLM gate, answer: traveling to Kuala Lumpur? OMG, my response was that KLM is an airline not a city? My trust in her went from 10 to zero in a second. I approached someone else, she understood my question. Sir, you go to terminal 1. But what terminal am I now? I had to take a train and then a bus to terminal 1. How to find this train? well no signs to be find anywhere. I ended up in B. Asked again where to find the train, take escalator down, and then blah blah blah. Was in B now. Okay, now to find a bus - where? No clue. No sign, wanted to look a tv screens where to find my KLM flight, still no information about non Emirates flights. After asking 4 times to staff where to find the bus service, I got confused. Go against security flow, use staff exit. Huh? Staff exit? Makes no sense. Then found a door for the bus, employee there informed me that bus interval timings is 40 minutes. I had to wait for 15 minutes. This bus trip took me another 15 minutes. Then ended in terminal 1. Security check, again. Long queue, very rude local staff at detector. And finally, tv screens with departing flights of D pier. Long walk to D19. Okay, first entered bus from platform at 23.15, was at my departing gate at 00.45! Took me 90 minutes to find my gate. No time to relax, eat, shop whatsoever. Luckily my transit time was 3 hours. As a very frquent traveler, Dubai is my number one worst experience ever? Dreadful, Emirates first concept, confusing, enormous huge airport. Never again want to be in transit again at Dubai airport.

Dubai,"I have ""enjoyed"" Dubai many times over the last few months and it is a truly awful airport. Access to it or from it by road is really bad, especially at peak times and there is no effective public transport system. Terminal 1 is the non Emirates terminal and is by far the best at Dubai. The issues tend to be that it is a long walk from your gate and you have to use a not very efficient transit to get to arrivals or departures. I arrive very early in the morning and it tends to be efficient in immigration (if you use the e-gates) and on baggage, There is plenty of room outside to get picked up. Departures is a whole different matter - I tend to leave late Thursday and at that point the terminal has de-generated into chaos. No room outside for your car to pull up, hassling porters and complete disrray inside as this is a peak departure time. E gates speed ,you up but the queues at security are horrendous. This airport is mainly about transiting passengers and is designed as such. There are a few decent restaurants and lots of shops but it is a deeply unwelcoming place. Terminal 3 - the main Emirates terminal is horrendous. On arrival the queues can be extremely long, if you arrive out of hours the transit trains take an eternity, the layout when you get off the train for transit versus arriving passengers is unclear and the process to get your bag is arduous. So far so bad, It then gets worse - the queues for taxis are endless, if you have arranged a driver it will take him at least 30 minutes to get out of the terminal parking area On departuer there are all of the same problems of T1 but multiplied by the volume of activity - it is now so bad that I fly to Manchester via Heathrow rather than take the direct fllight as the T1 experinece is so bad. Less focus on shopping and forcing numbers up, and more focus on looking after travellers would not go amiss. The other thing I find astonishing is lack of people to help and really poor customer service - things you don't experience elsewher in Dubai",4,Departure Only,October 2019,Business,Departure Only,3,N/A,2,4,3,3,2

The outlets are selling super heavy priced items. Emigration process was smooth and the guys behind each desks are friendly. Not enough seating available after the emigration area besides the Duty Free shops.

In the morning, when I was transiting, there were at least 10 people ahead in the queue for the bathroom, and I passed 5 or 6 before giving up and waiting in the queue.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have used Dubai airport several times now (perhaps 5 or 6 ). In every case, between the UK and New Zealand, a very long haul which deserves a reasonably comfortable stopover. This airport is an absolute disgrace for a modern international ""hub"". My particular beef is with the mens' lavatories in Terminal 3. The problem is that there are simply not enough of them to cope with demand at peak times. They are appalling ! After the first time I went through Dubai I filled in one of the airport's online complaint forms. The airport completely missed the point, replying that the loos are cleaned n times per hour. That's not the point; the point being that there are not enough loos. The airport is full of empty bling shops with not enough space left for the essentials. And my wife tells me that the female loos are not much better either. The result is that passengers arrive at the gate at the last minute for their flights, which is difficult for the gate staff and ATC. The whole situation is completely unacceptable. Dubai puffs itself up as a premier business and holiday destination, but they can't even get the basics right at their ""flagship"" airport. Wake up, Dubai!

The Emiratis want you to spend money so there's plenty of high class shopping and food and beverage outlets. My biggest gripe is the lack of showers - OK there are some free showers but you need your own towel and who carries them in hand luggage?

Like most thongs in Dubai, they have worked on biggest is best, and not an ounce of quality or class is featured in what they produce. Shops focus on sweets, tobacco and alcohol and are seething and unpleasant. F&B choices are fairly low standard, presumably because it is the budget / low cost travel market that Emirates targets. Miles and miles of walking, queues can be appalling and majority of staff are just rude.

On arrival at T3 the signage was appalling and it was necessary to take a train to the main terminal. There was a long wait and no indication of when the train would arrive until it was almost there. This was followed by a very long wait for the luggage and yet more poor signage. When travelling home I found the departures lounge to be lacking in food outlets suitable for anything more than a snack. Why can’t Wetherspoons open there?! The Emirates plane was an hour and a half late leaving, due, partly to awaiting a connecting flight and then a lengthy wait to get to the runway and take off. Why, with all the space available, are there just 2 runways at such a busy airport and why was only one in use on 3/3/19? Heathrow is far more efficient with just two runways and, unlike Dubai, it has very limited options to increase this.

I have travelled for more than 50 years and if all airports were like this one I would have stopped travelling years ago. I have used this airport many times going back 30 years and it has got progressively worse. Staff are unhelpful, security staff are the most ignorant, rude and aggressive people I have ever encountered, these people should realise we pay their wages and act accordingly.",1,Arrival and Departure,January 2019,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,2,2,2,2,2,N/A,1
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | As my first time flying anywhere I found with only a 1 hour layover it was a struggle to get to C19 for my connection. If it wasn't for almost jogging I wouldn't have made it as I found after asking a staff member I had to get a shuttle bus which seemed to take forever. Then there was a long walk to the gate after I got there I sat in the lounge and they were calling us on to the plane 5 minutes later. I would never go again with such a tight connection time. Would rather have at least 2 hours. I had a much better time on the way back from Australia as my arrival was in the same place as my conection ie I didn't need to get a bus, also I found a smoking lounge so was able to relax with a cigarette or 3, people seem very friendly to me I can't really see any problems.",8,Arrival and Departure,December 2018,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,3,4,4,4,5
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I arrived in terminal 3 with a connection from T1. What a nightmare, over an hour to get there. It’s not the process that’s a problem, but the appalling signage. I do on average 30 round trips a year so not a novice, and generally I can navigate airports under my own steam, but Dubai defeated me and I had to ask for help 3 times. No idea how the poor laborers cope.",2,Transit,February 2019,Business,Transit,4,3,1,0,N/A,5,4
Dubai,Not Verified |  No idea why this airport gets bad reviews. For example people complaint about screwdrivers being confiscated is quite funny and ridiculous. Well run airport with staff waiting at gate for late connections and fast transfer via train shuttle when needed. Great duty free prices too. Anyone who rates this 2 star should try LHR or God forbid CDG. Only downside I encountered was an information lady giving out wrong info re hotel shuttle to Hampton by Hilton Airport. Told there was not one but there 100% is!,9,Arrival Only,February 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,5,4,5,4,5,N/A,3
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Somewhat underwhelmed. As for duty free, wow, I wouldn't like to see the prices before the duty was taken off!! Supermarkets back home much cheaper.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I've arrive from Copenhagen and after two days I departed to Warsaw. Both of them Arrival service was located at the end of the airport which was almost 15 mintues from pass control. Due to midnight time all security and luggage control didn't took much time. I was outside the airport in around one hour after landing. My flight back was starting at 8:05 AM so I was at the airport at 3:30AM and dropped my luggage in empty counter. I had to pay for over-sized luggage in separate counter and then I've got a boarding pass. Security control in Dubai is a completely different story. I can't understand why any of cables except laptop and mobile chargers. Due to my profession (network IT), I'm carrying many of the cables in my cabin bag in separate plastic bag (ethernet, USB printer cable, USB-RS232 converters, computer power cable). On my previous flight a lot of them was confiscated and this time I was more clever and put them to checked-in luggage to avoid same action. However due to remaining electronics all stuff was removed from my bag and this takes a lot of time wasted.I really didn't understand why cables cause a problem only in Dubai but they are no problem in any other airport around the world. However when I got finally to terminal I found a hundreds of people lying everywhere around on the floor. Whole airport looks like shelter for homeless people. I found one gate unoccupied and sit ther to use an internet. Connection was quite ok, enough to watch movies but internet disconnect very often, more less each 10-15 minutes was off. Boarding was was very messy. Airport staff didn't divide us to groups so during boarding a lot of people from groups D, E and F was waiting around the gate while they had been stopped during boarding previous groups.",2,Arrival and Departure,January 2019,Business,Arrival and Departure,4,3,5,0,N/A,2,2
Dubai,✅ Trip Verified | Arrived in Dubai on time and went down to security which took 15 minutes and proceeded to bus. Noticed on way that gate was already open (if true it was open an hour as the ticket says 4:05). Got on bus which took a very long time as he got caught in some sort of jam at the end. Took at least 30 -40 minutes. Followed signs to a second security check  and then checked board to find the gate had closed! Tried to explain this to the rep at the connections desk but she (and the supervisor she supposedly contacted) were adamant that the aircraft had arrived on time and I would have to pay for a new ticket (how is it on time when the gate is already open at 4:05). By my calculations it was physically impossible for me to go from area B to A in the short time the gate was remaining open. At no time did it say on the board that boarding was occurring (not that that would have mattered since I couldn't have gotten there anyway). Setting up a situation where a passenger can't physically make the connection and then making money at his expense is despicable and Dubai/Emirates have lost far more money from me than the 160 euro their scamming staff at Dubai airport swindled me out of. Be careful everyone that you allow at least 3 hours transit time if going through this airport to avoid this scam. Very disappointed at the level this airport has sunk to.,2,Transit,January 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,2,1,3,1,N/A,1
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Note: this review is written by a handicapped traveller. This airport is my biggest disappointment of the year. I went there expecting a lot which is the reason of the 6 hour layover. When I went there, only 2 handicapped toilets in the whole of concourse B of therminal 3 and those toilets weren't even that great. I was expecting more not just from the airport but from Dubai.

Dubai,Not Verified |  Dubai airport is the worst airport. The staff are really unprofessional and do not take care of your flights. It's best to avoid connection flights via Dubai.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Horrible transit experience at Dubai airport! We arrived from our Emirates flight from Oslo on 1 dec 2018 10 mins later and was put on the shuttle bus to our gates. To our horror, the whole journey took more than 1 hour! There were frequent stops, and we had no idea why it stopped because there were no announcements whatsoever on what was happening. Turns out there was bad congestion due to construction work. And I know this only because I asked one of the ground staff when we alighted from the bus. This is horrible customer service. There should be basic decency to at least inform your passengers what was going on! I am thankful we had a 3 hour transit time but I wonder how many passengers would have missed their connecting flight as a result of this delay.",4,Transit,December 2018,Couple Leisure,Transit,2,2,4,3,2,4,2
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I transited twice at this airport in the last couple of months. On the outward journey there were no problems, but on the return the handling by the transit security was atrocious. So slow that several passengers had to scurry around the airport to find an alternative security post in order to avoid missing our connections. Later, when at home I send Emirates airlines a message via their online feedback system. Their response was basically 'we have no control', but both airline and airport have the same owner: the Dubai government. I will not use this airport again.",2,Transit,November 2018,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,4,4,3,2,N/A,1

Dubai,Not Verified | I was taking a connecting flight from Gate B10 to Hyderabad. Multiple lights in the seating/waiting area keeps on flashing. Not enough laptop power adapters. Dirty floors and seats. I don't think the seats and the flooring area don't get cleaned often. There is a smoking area close to gate B10. Looks like the smoke is leaving the smoking area.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | A great shopping airport but have they forgotten the fundamentals of an airport. After a long ride and arriving, next thing you want to do, is to freshen up and go to the washroom. It is always crowded, probably the space has been allocated to retail. Really never been to any airport is Asia, where washrooms are in so short in supply. Bad design, queuing will take at least 20 min, for both men and women, not forgetting, if it is praying time where people need to wash up and pray. Where I come from, washroom is so plentiful. No need to queue, spacious, and I can relax inside. In Dubai airport, you can hear the breathing of someone outside your door.

The lack of facilities like toilets badly needs addressing. Also there is a lack of moving walkways, which means even walking just one or two gates can take considerable time. However there are positives including the wide range of shopping and eating options here, although even McDonald's seems to be too pricey. Also the security checkpoint has improved drastically from a few years ago and is now very efficient.

Dubai,"Not Verified |  Dubai airport leaves much to be desired. One can shop for a million unnecessary gadgets, toys, liquor, and a lot more. However, if you need to find seating or visit a bathroom, you are in for a rude surprise. Firstly, the number of toilets/bathrooms is woefully inadequate, so there are always long lines. Second - the bathrooms are filthy and smell bad. There is virtually no air movement inside. Third - almost 50% of the taps/faucets in the bathrooms I visited did not work. Fourth - almost all soap dispensers did not have soap in them. On my previous pass through this airport, I was in business class and used the business lounge in terminal B. The was a similar absence of sufficient number of bathrooms/toilets, in similarly poor condition. While I enjoyed flying on Emirates, the poor state of the Dubai airport will make me use another airline in the future.

No customer service, staff that don't want to be there, no consistency - some want to see my visa, others don't, some question, some don't. Terminal 1 is far way better than 2 or 3.

I asked the people at the gate but no one paid me any attention. I reported to the police station but noone could give me their time. I asked for the camera's to be looked at but got resistance.

Dirty seating if you can find a chair. The biggest surprise was queues of 5+ men at absolutely every toilet in the terminal (often 10+ women). Weak air conditioning and the smell of cigarette smoke throughout the terminal. Premium lounges were packed with no seating available. Temporary walls and confusing makeshift signage everywhere. Poorly designed duty free shops clogging every bit of free space. There is airport staff posted up everywhere, but they just stand around answering questions and don't act proactively to organize and clean up the chaos and mess that is Terminal 3. It took over 30 minutes to ride the bus from the remote gate to the terminal upon landing. Not what you expect when arriving at your airline's global hub on a long haul aircraft after a 7 hour flight. Overall a hugely disappointing experience from a 21st century airport striving to be the world's leading transit hub.

Staff were polite, helpful, extremely friendly and always responding with a smile. We left the chck-in desk and went to the busy security line. Staff at security never acknowledging passengers politely.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I came with my wife and our two teenage kids from Zurich with Emirates in economy class (great airplane, good service, nice overnight flight), and arrived around 6am in the morning. From the docks to the train onwards to immigration, everything worked smoothly but then, at immigration, we had to wait for maybe 40 minutes. That is a pitty, as it is a) unnecessary, and really unpleasant for any visitor (especially the elder people and the parents with little children sitting on the floor as they are simply to tired early in the morning with no breakfast). So, as Dubai and Emirates do not aim for second best in any aspect, I would expect the Dubai Airport Authoroties to consider any option that cuts the waiting time down to a short instance, with maybe 2-3 minutes waiting. That is one of the important benchmarks met not only by leading competing Airports (such as Singapor Changi) but even by more tratditional ones such as Zurich. So, as the Cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi have left us with an outstanding first impression, I do hope, and remain confident that Dubai Airport will take action and very soon turn this Chokepoint into a Swift and efficent Checkpoint as it is an industry standard. From then on, I will be happy to recomend this Airport to any friend or business partner. Thanks in advance!",5,Arrival and Departure,April 2018,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,5,3,2,3,3
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Departure - We did the online check in before hand and arrived at the airport approximately 1 hour 50 minutes before the flight time. There was a long queue as several flights were leaving during the evening hours. It took almost 45 minutes to complete the baggage drop and to collect the boarding pass. Immigration was quick and the airport had limited seating and food choices. Further, all the aircrafts are parked at a distance and everyone has to go through the bus. Time was just enough to complete the formalities and board the plane. Arrival: Arrived from Yerevan on 31st March at 10.30 pm. Flight was 30 minutes late and it took a further 25 minutes to reach the terminal by bus. Immigration check was very quick and was completed within 5 minutes. Immigration officer was very much welcoming and this was very good. However, it took almost 40 minutes for the baggage to arrive. It was frustrating to wait that long and there was no information available and no flydubai staff were seen anywhere near. This is uncharacteristic of Dubai airports. I heard from regular users of Dubai Airport Terminal 2 that late arrival of baggage is very common. Why Dubai airport terminal 2 is having this issue, although this is the revenue generating terminal (as there are no fancy passenger facilities such as lounges, huge buildings and waiting area etc..). All the good experience by the flight is nullified by this waiting time and hence the low rating.",4,Arrival and Departure,March 2018,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,3,4,3,N/A,3,3
Dubai,❎ Not Verified |  Not enough toilets (and extremely dirty): just a few for thousands of passengers. Incredible. Not enough place to sit so that many people sit on the floor. They opened the gate more than one hour before departure in order to take us to a lounge with no toilets again and poor air conditioning. On arrival they took us by bus from the plane: it look more than 20 min to drive. There is a lot of traffic on the way and the bus has often to wait until some other cars pass first (buses with passengers should have a priority on crossroads etc in such cases!).

Perhaps due to extensive renovation works, passengers were sprawled over seats, the floor, etc. There were also many confused passengers wandering around, which added to the congestion. Confused passengers were also allowed to wander up and down along the customs counters before their passports were checked. Security checks at the gate were not consistent. Once the holding area (for full body and bag checks) was half filled - maybe 17 passengers - the others were routed through another way. So about 17 checked for every 50 not checked.

In addition there are a lot of steps to walk down from First in a 380 Airbus to the ground and one needs to carry the luggage yourself, the crew did not help. We must have arrived the same time with other big aircrafts. There was no Fast Track available for Business or First and the Security check was pure chaos with a very unpleasant experience.

I just wanted to share my experience with you so that your team can strive for making a traveler's experience comfortable at Dubai Airport. As I had a long layover at Dubai Airport, I had to pass through at least five security checkpoints on Terminal 3 and D to search for a place to sleep. I was carrying an extension cord with me for my electronic gadgets in my carry-on baggage. The security staff at Terminal D confiscated it from me while everyone else let me go through with it. I checked the rules on Emirates' website as well as Dubai Airport's website and could not find extension cords in the list of restricted items in a carry-on baggage. I reasoned with the security but they neither provided me with a valid reason nor returned the cord to me. I would appreciate it if Dubai Airport/Emirates clearly mention extension cords as a restriction so that travelers do not have to go through a rude experience at a security checkpoint.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai Airport is very large. On my flight to Cairo from Singapore via Dubai Airport the plane was parked remotely, resulting in the need to take a bus to the airport for the arrival flight and departing flight. The bus ride to the airport was exceptionally long and took a good 20 minutes at least. The airport felt exceptionally crowded to the point that I wonder if the airport’s infrastructure does not seem to be able to cope in terms of seats, toilets and lounges. Most of the passengers seemed to be either sitting on the floor or standing around. Long queues were forming outside the limited number of toilets as the toilets are very far apart. There seemed to be only one lounge servicing each concourse, visited the Marhaba Lounge which was so crowded that we had to queue 20 mins to register and share tables with others. The signage in the airport is a bit confusing as it seemed to point you in circles.",5,Transit,December 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,1,2,1,4,4,2
Dubai,"❎ Not Verified |  I've been flying from Dubai for almost 9 years and each time this airport's impressed me. Toilets are clean and tidy, parking area isn't all busy and chaotic, and check-in and security desks have very few queues. Signs and directions are clear and in English and Arabic. We arrived at the airport without our boarding passes and the check-in desks didn't not make the situation worse. Even though this airport isn't as good as the airport in Singapore, it still gets us from A to B safely.",9,Departure Only,July 2017,Family Leisure,Departure Only,4,4,4,0,N/A,N/A,4
Dubai,✅ Trip Verified | Flight cancelled supposedly due to bad weather. No information given. 4 hours after the initial departure time we are still waiting standing up - for more than 3 hours - to access the only desk available for people with connection flights. Cancellations can happen. However not a single bit of information / explanation or indications to know which line we need to queue at given during the extreme long wait is totally unacceptable. Service level has to be experienced not only when everything is ok but especially when it is not.,2,Departure Only,December 2017,Family Leisure,Departure Only,4,3,1,0,N/A,3,1
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Business class lounge in B concourse, hot food not warm even. Range of products very limited, asked staff about this and just got reply, cutting back to save money.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Having transited through Dubai numerous times over the past few years I had thought that a 2.25 hour layover would have been totally fine. However upon stepping through the aircraft doors I realised we were parked up at some truly distant dusty corner and would have to enjoy yet another bus tour of the airport. This time however it took a full 30/35 minutes of driving before we eventually arrived at a gate. I ran up to the business lounge, quickly used the restroom, had a 5 minute shower (thankfully no queue), changed then ran to the gate and had a full 5 minutes to sit down before boarding started for the next leg of my journey. As the magical mystery tours of the airport seem to get longer each time I use this airport I’d advise people to think carefully about connection times any shorter than 3 hours. Things really need to change with the approach to air bridges and use of bus transfers off flights. Having to choose between eating or showering isn’t exactly what I had in mind when travelling business class.",6,Transit,December 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,4,5,5,5,5,5

Dubai,"❎ Not Verified |  As with previous time, overcrowded and overflowing toilets. Disgusting. Minimal seating and zero thought to seating provided, ie no legroom in many cases due to attempt to wedge more into small area. Construction saws and boarding.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | The airport is far too big - making transport from one place to another highly inefficient. The airplane had to taxi for 15 min before coming to a stop, followed by another 10 min wait to board buses. Buses were highly crammed, and the duration of travel to the desired terminal was another 10-15 min. All the toilets had super long queues. Floors are highly dirty, and chairs have rubbish left. Then again, another train had to be taken to transit to another gate. This just leads me to conclude one thing: the airport is far too big to be run efficiently. Lack of cleaners - leading to dirty floors, too long travel time from one area to the next. Only decent thing is shopping is ok.",1,Transit,December 2017,Family Leisure,Transit,1,1,3,4,4,5,3

Dubai,✅ Trip Verified | Best duty free and dining I have ever experienced at an airport. Concourse area was very clean and sign boards were properly installed so it was very easy to locate your gate.

Dubai,❎ Not Verified |  Ground service was terrible. Flight and gate change announcement was not clear and when I missed the flight I had to pay USD 100 to get my ticket changed. When I wanted to claim this they said it was my fault that I did not check the screen and they do not do announcements because theirs is a quite airport. Toilets were always dirty and their service staff in the toilets were always scolding people for sprinkling water on the floor when they wash their hands. Airport wifi is free and very bad quality.,1,Transit,September 2017,Business,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Dubai,"❎ Not Verified |  Ultimate airport Dubai it may be, but as far as I'm concerned the treatment in Security is appalling. With metal in my knees due to knee replacements, I'm used to the alarms going off, and being singled out for additional screening. But never in my life have I been shouted at by a security official, as though I was somehow a second-class traveler. What is ""Lady room"", how should I know that it's the separate screening area for women, when there is no sign, the official does not indicate where, and when I hesitate, screams at me to ""go to Lady room immediately"".

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I left Dubai airport with mixed feelings. Obviously it is an exceptionally busy airport, one of the busiest in the world in fact, and it has to cope with that volume of passenger traffic. This means it needs to have a design that helps people quickly get to their destination. I found the airport layout a bit unhelpful. It is practically a set of three straight buildings, shops in the middle, gates at the edges. There are hundreds of shops (if not more) if you want to buy an expensive watch or clothing, but if you want something to eat or drink, good luck. The B building has a McDonalds with around 20-30 tables, and 500 people queuing. I rush to the departure gate, because the displays show ""Boarding"" to find that boarding hasn't started. But because of the boarding sign, a queue of around 400 passengers is standing in the airport corridor, waiting to board an A380. Boarding only starts 30 mins later, after almost being run over by electric vehicles carrying seemingly young and healthy passengers around the airport. Then, we have to show our passports at least 4 times before boarding the aircraft. Flight departs 1 hr late because of runway change before boarding the plane.",4,Arrival and Departure,November 2017,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,2,3,1,4,5,3
Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | The security arrangements at this airport is a disgrace, it's chaos with people pushing their way in. There should be a laned system in place as soon as you are through passport control and this would save all the pushing and shoving. Area seems too small to cope with the amount of passengers. Takes so long to get through security that you have hardly any time to enjoy shopping or eating before your flight. Didn't help that I wasn't aware that concourse C was the furthest away from check-in as its usually B gates our flight left from, which wasn't the airports fault, but I couldn't have been the only one as our gate was nearly closing and there were people running to make it before it did.",2,Departure Only,November 2017,Family Leisure,Departure Only,4,2,2,3,3,N/A,3

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  The airport's design is stunning (Terminal 3 in particular), informative signs and a huge spacious and clean terminal are just a few of the many things this airport consistently prides itself on, and no wonder, they even give you wifi for free! Certainly puts many airports in the UK to shame, including my local airport (Birmingham). That said, the duty free does lack variety in some areas and on arrival, we parked on a remote stand, which, while alright if you've flown on Ryanair to any EU destination, isn't the best start to a holiday in Dubai.

Dubai,"❎ Unverified |  I went to Dubai Airport to pick up my wife and saw for the first time the new ticket parking machines where they have No. Plate Recognition Cameras, when I came out there was no problem paid at the machine got out easy, however when I went to drop her off at the airport and came to pay at a machine that's when I discovered that they don't give change. I had to go back into the airport to get some change, when I got back to the machine it had gone up from 20 to 30 dirhams. If you're going to install machines that don't offer change it would be nice if you put in machines next to them that can. What was wrong with the previous system, they gave change. I think there's some sort of warning as you enter but that's too late if you haven't the correct money and it's unfair to ask any business inside to change your money. Rant over but 30 parking and pay for coffee to get change = 50 dirhams just to park for about 30mins = expensive.",7,Arrival and Departure,October 2017,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,N/A,4,0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  GLA-DXB-AKL, AKL-DXB-GLA. Emirates have now taken over Concourse C for their own operations, with other airlines sent to Concourse D, but the downside of this is a transit process which can be even longer than ever (half an hour from the far end of Concourse C, to the far end of Concourse A). The outgoing transit felt fairly rushed, the return, with over two and a half hours for the transit, was much easier. On both legs, the screening process for transit passengers was pretty quick (0800/0500). But I would have to agree with others' comments here - the concourses feel too crowded, and the queues for even the men's toilets suggest a lack of planning somewhere along the way.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  I will admit I used to get excited by the prospect of stopping at Dubai Airport, but now it all seems a chore. It's way too overcrowded and is generally just a lot of hard work. There's never an airbridge so you have to get a bus (which seems to take longer each time I go). By the time you finally get to the duty free areas you are so tired you just want to lie down and get some rest but finding a seat is often hard work in itself. There are queues in the bathrooms. My father and mother use the wheelchair service which is terrible. They just plant them down in some room and wait until the last minute to get them to the gate. You can't even ask to push them yourself so that you have flexibility. So overall its too big, too commercial and I think out of sync with current times. This is not what retail is about nowadays.",1,Transit,October 2017,Family Leisure,Transit,1,1,2,2,1,1,1

Two arrivals and two departures in transit, arrival and departure on A380 via air bridge, arrival on B777 at an air bridge but departure via bus, which means a long drive and very hot walk across the tarmac.

Dubai,"❎ Unverified |  Firstly, getting off the plane onto rickety, uneven stairs is unsafe. I'm fairly fit, so I consider myself lucky. But I felt very sorry for older individuals, and parents with young children/babies for having to navigate these stairs. And then the shuttle bus. A short journey is fine, but a 25 minute shuttle-bus to get to the terminal? Where in heaven's name was that plane relative to the terminal, exactly? There was no seating on the shuttle bus, and ventilation was poor. I felt slightly faint, and was very grateful when we (finally) got to the terminal. And then I had to navigate more queues in the terminal for the toilets. Another 25 minutes in a queue just to use the facilities, where 4 out of the 10 cubicles were ""out of order"" and the ceiling in the functioning toilet cubicle that I used was dripping water on me as I attempted to relieve myself. The only saving grace were the racks under the sinks to place your hand luggage as you freshened up, which at least meant that I didn't have to dry a spot by the sink for the bag. I couldn't bear the thought of queueing again (all the eateries I passed by had long queues) to buy a drink, nor could I find a water fountain, so I elected to go thirsty until I boarded the next flight.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  Apart from others, there is one point that is very disappointing regarding Dubai Airport. Showers for passengers not having access to any of the lounges are a shame for an Airport who thinks so highly of itself! After a 9 hour flight from Cape Town to Dubai, and another 6 hours ahead of me, I wanted to refresh myself and was looking for the possibility of having a shower. What I found was very disappointing was the smelly room with no possibility to get access to a towel or any other facilities that are usually necessary when taking a shower. There is a plethora of possibilities to spend money at the airport but no service that would allow me to rent a towel, shower in a clean environment and then take the next leg of my flight refreshed!

Dubai,"Transit at Dubai airport was a disappointing experience on 2 of my last trips. I had high expectations since anyone would assume that the transit hub of Emirates would be of great quality. But it's not! First of all, expect to be stuck in a bus from your plane to / from the terminal for more than 20 minutes. Ours was almost 40, due to traffic in the airport streets. Then an unexpected security check, with large queues especially on the busy hours. Prepare to spend at least an hour there, and also deal with ignorant and unfriendly staff. And the worst of all, the terminal is loud, overcrowded and dirty, with minimum signage and staff to help. The duty free shops are great, but what a traveler needs on a transit airport are basic amenities and some place to sit or rest and some clean toilets, which are hard things to find in Dubai terminal 3, unless you go to the lounges. Toilets were shockingly dirty and overcrowded, probably the worst I have ever come across in an international airport. It was also really hard to find a proper seat, even around your gate; on the contrary you would see people resting on the floor. The design of the upper floor gates space doesn't make much sense for the amount of people waiting for their flights there. There is no announcement, not even a sign with information about the next flight(s). You have to be impatient (like me) to notice whether the boarding has started or something else happened. I really felt uncomfortable the 2 times I had to transit there for 6 hours. OK someone can go to the lounges and be stress-free, but the majority of economy class travelers also deserve some proper amenities, which doesn't exist.",2,Transit,April 2017,Couple Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,3,4,5,1
Dubai,"The airport is huge and with numerous duty free shops, restaurants, international brands and snacks stalls etc. However, as an international transit airport we don't find it user friendly at all. If you want any snacks or food or just a cup of coffee, you must first go to the money changers to convert into local currency. With thousands of visitors flying in daily, I am sure it wouldn't be difficult for the shops to also transact in either US or Euro dollars. In fact, to do so, may just add up on improved sales. Although the duty free shops with its huge selection of liquors, chocolates, wines and other stuffs on sale, in reality these are priced way way above all other airports duty free shops. I could easily pick up the same product for less than 50% of the costs back home. It just doesn't make senses for anyone to buy anything here, unless it's for last minute forgotten token or gift for some love one back home.",2,Transit,May 2017,Family Leisure,Transit,4,2,3,1,1,1,2

Dubai,✅ Verified Review |  We landed at Dubai airport on 4 May 2017 and departed on 14 May. On arrival as we were a little jet lagged we were grateful to get our luggage rather quickly and cleared customs and immigration fast too. Could not see much as it was 6.25 pm or thereabouts and getting dusky. However on 14 May we checked in by 6pm although flight was at 8pm. This gave us the chance to see the departure area. There were no proper signs as to where to check in and we spent a good half hour standing in the wrong queue. I was surprised to see people sitting in groups on the floor and some even eating. The departure area is really run down and duty free is nothing to talk about. Thankfully there was intermittent wifi and frankly we were happy when we boarded our flight.,4,Departure Only,May 2017,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,2,2,1,2,2,2,2
Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  Awful. The transit between Terminals is appallingly slow and inconvenient.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  Overcrowded and very poor security. I was sitting on an bench at Starbucks and noticed an unattended bag. Thinking not much about it I let it go for 20 minutes. Then I realized my responsibility to public safety (and myself) and told a Dubai airport attendant (they wear the blue shirts), who informed me that security had been informed. 20 more minutes later security never showed up! You can imagine my concern as a foreign traveler. Fortunately the owner showed up. I informed the same blue-shirt attendant that the owners of the bag were now right in front of me and they just stood there staring, not attempting to inform the bag owner of their responsibilities to monitor their baggage. As for the overcrowding, you can't check into the gates until 2 hours prior to your flight and there's NO where to go except one tiny Starbucks. If a consumer is willing to pay to get into a restaurant and away from the crowds why on earth wouldn't there be more places to go? I'm so used to seeing Dubai do things way over the top, but Dubai International is even below western standards when it comes to flying. And the bathrooms are disgusting, and smell awful.",2,Departure Only,May 2017,Business,Departure Only,1,1,4,1,3,3,1
Dubai,"Transit in Dubaï is becoming more and more an ugly experience, provided that with the growth of their fleet, Emirates is not docking to gates when your a note travelling on A380's. So then comes the bus trip, among luggage trolleys and gazoline trucks. Long, very long, turning here and there in an endless journey through this huge airport. During my last trip, Geneva - Dubai - Bangalore return, we spent between 30min to 45min in the buss. Due to short transit, rest of it was about running in the terminal to catch next plane. Somehow a good way for them to reduce the time (and cost) spent in the lounges, but in the end a very poor experience.",3,Transit,April 2017,Business,Transit,5,N/A,5,0,N/A,N/A,2
Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  We experienced transit, arrival and departure this month. Transit wasn't too bad as we only 2 hours there, long enough to be fleeced by the bar (£10 for a beer) and shake shack (I think it was called that, £7 for a shake). The positives were that there were some drinking water fountains in the airport, however the first one we tried dispensed warm water. Boarding was ok although as ever it's clear that Emirates do not care about their economy class passengers. 2 weeks later we arrived back at DXB for a one night stopover, the arrival was straightforward, passport control was easy and the bags were quick. However when we got to the taxi rank we were directed to a car by someone who looked like they worked there, only to be ripped off by a £40 fare to the palm. Even if the guy there wasn't an employee, any airport that cared for it's customers would stop these con artists from being at the airport. The last straw was when we departed Dubai the following day. The check in staff were the most miserable and ignorant I have encountered at any airport, likewise the passport control guy seemed to hate people, and really had no care for his job. Even with my polite ""good morning"" to anyone we encountered, responses were non-existent. Then at the gate were were subjected to further security by ignorant staff. After this there was an announcement that anyone with duty free liquid would need to speak to staff as it would not be allowed on the plane, there were no Emirates staff around and the security guards were completely disinterested, the woman at security was too busy playing with her phone to help. We were so delighted to leave Dubai and would happily never return to this dump of an airport - it may look nice but if you fill it with the worlds most ignorant staff it will never be a nice place. The wifi was useless and ridiculously slow on each visit",3,Arrival and Departure,April 2017,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,3,4,1,3,1,1
Dubai,"✅ Verified Review | Everything at Dubai Airport is made for you to enjoy your transit. It's probably the biggest transit hub in the world. Shopping mall and food court has no equivalent, and, surprisingly, it's not as expensive as I expected. The very good points of the airport is the free showers, which are very welcomed on long trips, and the relaxing chairs, by thousands, helping you to get rest despite the huge traffic of travelers. The airport is however very large. Too large. It's hard sometimes to find your gate or your destination. The internal shuttle train is not very easy to use and is quite strange. I think the airport has improvements to do in matter of information and signs to become even more efficient and convenient.",7,Transit,November 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,5,2,5,5,5,5
Dubai,"✅ Verified Review | I'm sure my last two transits through Dubai (a few years ago) were in the late-night peak hours but I don't remember crowding anywhere near as bad as this. People were sprawled across the floor because the seats were full but staff were still trying to run people over with the electric carts. Restaurants were full and loud. When you can find power points (best is in restaurants as I had a hard time finding any in the general area), they're not universal points, which seems an oversight in a major transit airport. Boarding was smooth when I got to it, and the security check on arrival was quick and easy. Wifi worked well despite having to serve a lot of people. On my other transit a week ago, it was daytime and a 1:25 transit that turned into 2 hours. They still couldn't transfer everyone's bags. Emirates is generally a good experience in the air but the poor work standards in Dubai hurt the airport and admin sides of their business.",5,Transit,April 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,1,3,2,3,4,2
Dubai,"✅ Verified Review | Airport in Dubai is very large and for this size of airport everything works there really perfectly. The only thing what I can say as a disadvantage it is that at peak times when few of Airbuses A380 arrive there is really big queue to passport control.

When flying to Europe I choose to go via Hong Kong - efficient friendly and quick. Why oh why Qantas chose this place to route through to Europe.

Terrible experience in Dubai Airport from the moment we landed. Taxiing took about 20 minutes and then another 40 minutes in the bus, with luggage in hand, standing with little children after a long overnight flight arriving from London. And that was the easy part. We landed at 0800 and it is now 0935 and still in the passport queue. This is torture, and what makes it worse is seeing a lot of the officers going about chatting or looking at their phones rather than opening extra counters. There were about a 1000-2000 people in various queues for passport control. They have got to do better than this!

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review | Had to use Dubai's Terminal 3 whilst travelling from London to Sydney. Many people rave about this airport but I honestly do not get the hype. Landed on time into Dubai but was made to wait for about 15 minutes because an Emirates flight was delayed and still using our gate. Whilst I understand delays and the tight scheduling and capacity of airports, it doesn't make the transfer pleasant. Signage is good but having no tables or area for the transit screening is ridiculous. As soon as you round the corner you're expected to have all electronics and liquids out but no area to do so. I found the terminal really warm (I know Dubai is hot) but air conditioning seemed non existent. Toilets are way overdue an upgrade and whilst 'clean' I wouldn't use in a hurry. I found the terminal too commercial and hard to find seating. I also found the gate area confusing with no announcements for flight and people from different flights seating in your gate area with no room for queues. I also don't understand the security check. Sure, all liquids have to be under 100ml but surely a bottle of water bought in the terminal in an attempt to cool down should be allowed on? Wouldn't recommend or travel through Dubai anytime soon.",3,Transit,March 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,1,4,1,1,2,2
Dubai,"When I must, I use Dubai Airport Terminal 2 to travel between the GCC countries with FlyDubai. Frankly, this terminal is an over-populated gateway to the other GCC countries. With seating far inadequate to house the hundreds of passengers passing through its doors daily and a quality of bathrooms equally poor, it is surprising that this terminal can be allowed to run the way it does. I aim to spend as little time in airports as possible owing to their prison-like feel - once you're inside the terminal, there is no getting out (until you reach your destination). I arrive, check in and go through security expecting to be boarding roughly 15 minutes later. It is not until I am through security, checked in, visited the dirty bathrooms and found a tight-squeezed spot to perch, that I find out that my flight has been delayed by an hour when I looked at the gates screen. Had this information been relayed to me 5 minutes earlier before entering, I would have opted for the cleaner option - anywhere but this terminal. The floors are covered in all manner of rubbish. It seems as though the staff have no control over what is going on, where. Rubbish? Pick it up. Dubai is said to be one of the best airports in the world. Fair to say the Emirates terminal is okay (just), however Terminal 2 is a shambles.

I couldn't even put my child on the changing table, as they were either broken or dirty! I had to spend several hours at this airport due to a delay and it was just awful with an infant.

Dubai,"DXB makes flying slow. I use this airport many times and every time it gets worse. For everything you need to do long queing is needed. Starting with airline approach. 3 to 4 extra rounds is average and quite annoying after long hours onboard the plane. Especially when arriving at T1 (non EK flights) a long walk follows along with taking a people mover to main building. Immigration and baggage return is not possible within less than one hour and then finally there are long queues for taxis. For departing its the same. Yesterday it took me one hour from check in to getting past the security check. Even at peak times only half of the security lanes are open. Once inside the gate area its quiet nice. But then again usually long taxiing and waiting till departure.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  Customer service was terrible. We arrived here at midnight from London and were made to wait two hours in a queue to getting through customs. It was so hot inside the terminal, just not good enough as there were nowhere near as many customs officers on duty as there should have been. There were so many empty counters without any staff. Two or three other airlines had arrived at the same time and the length of the lines of people waiting to go thru customs was just unacceptable. There were customs staff chatting away in private conversations with each other and ignoring the long line of travellers waiting to go thru. I found them to be very arrogant and ignoring the fact that the lines of people were so long was just not acceptable. When we got to a customs officer counter staff were not friendly with no smile or hello. We got out of the airport at 2.30am, our flight arrived at 12 midnight, when you have little kids the experience was not acceptable. The airport is too big, our experience arriving at Dubai on our first leg of our trip on the way to London the fact that you have to catch trains to go to different terminals once you arrive at the airport to check in and then walk for hours on end to actually get to the departure gate is something that I and my family was not expecting as first time travellers through Dubai airport. It's an airport I will try to avoid if I can and in the future will endeavour to stop over in Hong Kong or Singapore when travelling to the UK or Europe from Australia.",1,Arrival Only,January 2017,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,4,4,1,2,3,3,1
Dubai,"Agree with other reviews that Dubai airport is all about first and business class, and consumerism for the rest. There is a disconnect between Emirates which cares about customer whatever class, whereas Dubai airport cares only about the top spenders. It starts with not having a gate for a A380 with elderly pilgrims on the way to Mecca struggling down the stairs. Due to the size of the airport, the bus trip took forever with the poor elderly including myself still holding on for dear life. Not enough resting facilities in the most modern terminal 3. A far cry from Singapore where we mostly transit.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai airport has exceeded its capacity and is struggling under the sheer weight of passengers and flights to the extent that nearly every flight has some delay both on arrival and departure. Arriving from London the plane had to circle several times due to traffic and on departure the plane was delayed leaving the gate again due to the number of departures. Once we did push back and taxied there were 12 planes ahead of us waiting to depart with the overall effect that we were some 50 minutes late taking off. This is notwithstanding the sheer numbers of passengers in the terminal which, although is well laid out and functional, does not cater for the increased amount of travellers especially at busy periods.

Check in process was fast and painless, dedicated security checks and passport control speed up everything. Within minutes one can be at the lounge relaxing, or browsing at the wide range of duty free goods etc. One thing I noticed is some areas of the airport can be quite dim.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review | Dubai Airport is huge. It has to be given the number of Airbus A380s that Emirates fly to/from there. Yet somehow the departure lounge at Terminal 3 feels very overcrowded and cramped. The main walk through area is full of retail outlets, turning this into one big shopping mall. The gates are positioned to the sides and while these can be quieter, in order to find your gate you have to negotiate through the chaos. As a super-hub, it literally is where East meets West. The terminal consists of three concourses. A is on its own (connected by an underground rail system to the other concourses), while B and C are joined together. The look and feel of Concourses A and B are very similar, while Concourse C is older and much more relaxed. Footfall through A and B is far higher that through C. I personally found Concourse C nicer. It was quiet, the retail shops were on a lower lever and there were plenty of seats (plenty of sleeper seats too). My only fault with C was the dated ""hole in the floor"" toilets. Terminals A and B appear to have less seating, the queues for the toilets were ridiculously long and it all seems geared towards passengers spending money rather than passengers relaxing before/between flights. Our flight from CMB to DXB parked away from the terminal so we needed to board a bus, travel 10 minutes to Concourse A, walk inside, pass through Security, follow the signs to the rail system, take a train to Concourse B, then follow the conga line of passengers up several escalators to the main Departures area for our connecting flight. Not a great experience, and we literally had to run to catch our connecting flight to LGW. I'd continue to use DXB as a transit stop between London and Colombo in the future, but I will have to find a quiet area to wait, away from the shopping hordes.",7,Arrival and Departure,April 2016,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,3,4,3,5,N/A,N/A

However, our horrible experience happened at the gate. 2 Emirates staff were in charge of checking passports / visas. They weren't even police officers and were staff of the airline, but they treated passengers in the most unfriendly possible way. They were asking questions that a visa officer (while deciding on a visa) does not dare to ask.

We did not change planes we were just stopping there I guess to refuel, after walking an endless corridor we were subjected to scanning and body search. We had not even left the airport or terminal we arrived at . We then walked I endlessly again and up and down stairs to again be scanned and searched and water purchased at London airport taken off us.. We then lined up in a corridor without any explanation before reboarding the same plane. Now I am all for security but really! The staff are very rude and I hope I never visit there again, good luck if you are going there.",2,Transit,August 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,2,1,2,1,N/A,3,1
Dubai,"✅ Verified Review |  This airport has apparently no regard whatsoever for the passenger. Our flight to Cairo was delayed due to the crash landing there. It soon became obvious that the airport was hopelessly inadequate in their plans for any kind of disaster. There were no announcements at all to inform us of the reasons for the delays to all the flights. It appeared that most of the staff had disappeared, or were sent home. The boarding gate where we were waiting for our flight, the departure time of which had been delayed many times, was suddenly closed and the one person left ran away from her post, again without any explanation. We finally made our way to a desk where complete chaos reigned. there were about 5 people at the counters, with about twelve lines, each line having about 6 people abreast and countlessly long. People were understandably disgruntled and extremely hot, and there was a lot of pushing and shoving and cutting across. Several people looked like officials in charge but they were doing nothing productive, made no announcements and ignored the people shouting questions at them from the lines. This could have been controlled with a simple zig zag line control system such as they have at most civilized airports. We stood in line for about five hours in the early hours of the morning. This colossal chaos, lack of information and the ignoring of passengers needs, has convinced us never ever to fly Emirates again, even though we had been pleased with them before. Never again.",1,Transit,August 2016,Family Leisure,Transit,4,1,2,3,3,1,1
Dubai,Dubai airport is over rated. Departure area is like a small airport with no co-ordination. The ceiling is worn off in many places (after the security scan) which doesn't give the indication that you are in a world class airport. Only positive is the Duty free shopping and the choices of eating outlets.,5,Departure Only,June 2016,Business,Departure Only,2,2,3,4,4,3,4
Dubai,"We transited through terminal 3 on both our outward and return journey on an Emirates flight. We were really disappointed with the baby strollers that were supposed to be available. There seems to be no efficient system to re-stock the racks which are opposite the arrival gates. So if you are lucky, you can find a broken stroller. If not, you have to go through security and walk several kilometres before you can see another one. When we did find a few strollers available, they were all very dirty and some were broken or missing parts. Some racks provided hygienic covers but those were also not stocked properly. So you'd want to put a towel on the seat before putting your baby on it - but then you can't use the seat belts. There were very few baby changing facilities and the ones we did find were quite smelly.",1,Transit,August 2016,Family Leisure,Transit,2,1,4,2,3,1,3

Dubai,"Dubai airport is still a complete and utter shambles. After landing we were then crammed packed onto a transit bus in sweltering heat and poor AC, for over 30 mins. Then it was a free for all through the transit gates that wete insufficiently manned. A crazy run from terminal 3 to terminal 1 ensued. Arrived at gate and it took over 1 hour to get through the gate as their systems had crashed. The place was incredibly hot and there was much confusion, screaming and shouting. And that was just the staff. Here we are in Bali 3 days later and only 1 piece of baggage has arrived. 2 still missing and no one knows where it is. I count ourselves lucky. I've heard horror story after horror story in the last few days. The reality is DXB may claim itself to be one of the finest on the planet but it is under pressure when the real truth comes out. The airport is clearly operating way beyond capacity and in a moment of crisis it's all broken down.",2,Transit,August 2016,Family Leisure,Transit,3,2,2,3,2,1,2
Dubai,✅ Verified Review | Dubai airport is pathetic. The toilets were unclean and smelly. I had to wait till I could board before I could use the toilets.

Dubai,Complete and utter shambles at Dubai Airport on the day following the plane landing crash. Had to queue for over 7 hours (nearly 3 hours at the desk) to get rebooking on to Melbourne/New Zealand. No public announcements at any stage during the 24 hour delay. No communication from Emirates or airport staff as to what was going on. Booking staff tried hard but systems were hopeless. No suggestion that any contingencies had been put in place for this kind of situation. Eventually got a partial rebooking and a hotel voucher but only after 18 hours of absolute frustration. Many transit passengers queued for nearly 10 hours (in a unregulated scrum of people) to be told they may not get flights gor 3 days. Many at breaking point. If Emirates is the worlds biggest airline and Dubai the busiest international airport then a much much better level of performance should have been anticipated. It is in the event of the unexpected that quality of service is most exposed. Emirates and Dubail failed pretty miserably.,1,Transit,August 2016,Family Leisure,Transit,2,1,3,2,3,2,1
Dubai,Dubai airport in total chaos today. Flights are delayed and all connecting passengers have to wait in queues that last 6-10hrs to be told that they are in a fight the following day and given a coupon to a hotel. That is not the end though. You go out thinking that that you can at lest get some sleep and guess what. There are no hotel rooms. So looks like vouchers are worthless. Passengers are waiting more than 6 hours at the airport exit because they can't find any hotels. Totally useless customer service.,1,Departure Only,August 2016,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,2,1,2,1,1,1,1
Dubai,Dubai Airport is glass and glitz only but offers a complete lack of customer service. This airport is third rate when it comes to service. Staff rude to customers and do not care for their welfare. Shepherd customers around and have no sense that they are dealing with the people that keep them employed.

Dubai,"Flew through Dubai airport on the 21st of July while in transit. It is just a giant shopping mall really, essentially showing off that the UAE has money. Security screening experience is poor. Got told off for going under queuing barriers even though there was no queue, security screening point is overstaffed, and then there was this ""secondary check"" as you left the Emirates lounge to board which did a cursory check for liquids. Very annoying and told me to get rid of the water bottle I'd just picked up in the lounge. Didn't even have somewhere for me to pour the liquids out - I had to go back to the bathroom to do this. I get very easily dehydrated on flights and prefer to carry a water bottle with me, to have this pointless 'secondary screening point' after we'd already cleared the initial screening point and being forced was frustrating.",5,Transit,July 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,N/A,4,0,4,N/A,2

Flew with Emirates, long bus rides to and from aircraft disembarking through front of aircraft on stairs.

Dubai,"Dubai Airport certainly has a good reputation and is known for its flagship airline Emirates. My experience on my FRA-DXB-BOM leg was decent. It was very easy finding my next gate and options to eat, drink and shop were aplenty. The toilets were not so well serviced (there wasn't enough toilet paper). Layover was ~3 hours which is somewhat ideal, I think Emirates provides some of the best connections to India. On the way back the experience was much better. All in all, an excellent transit hub. It could do with more sleeping seats considering the traffic it receives, but I would already say it's quite good. Also, they can have more vegetarian/vegan options for food.",10,Transit,March 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,4,5,4,5,5,5

I've found the prices at Dubai duty free to have steadily increased over the past few years, not many bargains to be found. Used the Marhaba lounge on the way back as we had a 5 hour connection time. Found it very busy between 04.00 and 07.00 but still better than killing time walking aimlessly around. I read in the Gulf News that Dubai is going to be a smoke free airport within a month or two, so if you smoke give up or find another airport to transfer through.",8,Arrival and Departure,June 2016,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,4,5,5,3,3,4

Dubai,"Dubai Airport has been a regular haunt for me over the past couple of years on business for being in transit - it definitely depends on the time of the day whether it is a good experience or a poor one. Early morning between 1am and 4am seems busiest - no seats, long queues for limited amounts of toilets (who builds a massive new terminal and puts toilet facilities along the concourse with only 4/5 cubicles?) and long queues for security. Mostly I find myself running off one flight, barging past people and cutting in the security check queue to actually make it to the connected flight - stressful to say the least, but if you are there lunchtime/early afternoon it can be a very different experience with limited issues and some smiley staff. Emirates provide a great service from the UK so will continue to battle on.",6,Transit,March 2016,Business,Transit,4,2,4,4,3,4,2
Dubai,"I had requested 'special assistance' and for both arrival and departure at Dubai Airport and it was immaculately provided. On arrival we were parked off terminal and so an elevated carrier was waiting, took both (my fit wife and myself) on a 15 minute ride to the terminal were another helper was waiting. He took us through first class immigration where, for a change, the immigration officer was smiling and chatty, to baggage reclaim where he insisted on retrieving our cases - ""because they are too heavy for you madam"" - then pushed me all the way to the car park even though our son was waiting at the terminal. On departure the porter took us to a special check-in very close to the airport entrance where a wheelchair was waiting and again we went through staff / first class immigration and security, again with pleasant smiling staff to a separate lounge, where he even wheeled me round to get a coffee and a sandwich followed by a long walk to the gate, bridge and aircraft door.

We can all be impressed with the architectural grandeur but that is best looked at in magazines not in reality as a passenger. Yes, despite all the marble, chrome and lofty glass walls what you get is total indifference from staff (and that includes cafes, airline staff, customer service desks etc) and bus rides to and/or from planes that can no longer get to the terminal (and we are talking 10-15 minutes rides plus additional waiting in queues, standing on buses, climbing stairs outdoors in the heat and dust etc). I can't blame the staff they are just overwhelmed with passengers and understaffed. We used the terminal 3 times this month and it is a place we will be avoiding whatever the cost. Toilets - too few, too small and totally unable to cater for the demand, impossible to use without having to queue for up to 10 minutes for a cubicle, M or F. Attendants cannot keep up with constant cleaning. Local airline kindly provided us with a ""Meal Voucher"" as our last visit was a 4 hr transit, unfortunately the ""meal"" consisted of 1/3 of a bread roll and a black coffee with a very firm policy of take it or leave it and buy something yourself (which we had to do). Airline is still sitting on our complaint after 2 days so I am not hopeful of any change to their policy.

Could be better, but considering the footfall, its ok. Check in: Good. Passport control: Ok. Staffing not very flexible – arriving in rush hour causes long queue. Most staff friendly. E-Gate often not operational. Security check: Ok. Parking: Sufficient parking available, close to terminals, but high prices and confusing signage. Sufficient drop-off / pick-up zones.

Dubai,"One of the worst airports I've experienced. I went from Birmingham to Hong Kong with my husband by EK and transited at this airport where my nightmare began. After an 8 hour flight, we arrived at Dubai and found that we had to take a shuttle bus to get to terminals. We were exhausted but had to wait in the muggy bus carrying heavy bags for more than 15 min. When I began to lose my patience the bus left. It took like 20 min to get to the terminals and in the last 5 min, the driver turned on the air conditioner. Yes, the shuttle bus has air conditioners. Then why leaving customers waiting in a packed and muggy bus for like half an hour without turning air conditioners on? Finally, we arrived at the terminal. It has the worst service ever. The people working there are rude and impolite. There's no ""please"", ""thanks"" and ""sorry"" coming out from their mouths. Using the internet is another nightmare at Dubai Airport. You can use free wifi for only one hour. The signal is so poor that I have to reconnect over and over again. Also, the toilets are dirty and smelly. Can you imagine that it is the gate to a rich and attractive city? I'm disappointed. Yes, it is beautiful and there're luxury decorations everywhere.

It is noisy with bright lights, it stinks of perfume, it is not clean and definitely on its way down. The choice of bars and restaurants is extremely poor, not in quantity but in quality and they all feel filthy. Moreover, I have never ever experienced a flight leaving on time.

A strange start for a review but for years I have been traveling thru Terminal 1 and had such high expectations for the finish of Terminal 3. Well after a couple of years using Terminal 3 I am now stating for the record that a Terminal designed exclusively for the State backed high end Emirates Airlines falls a little short of the mark. The opulence of design is there, has fantastic choices for restaurants, has a massive amount of shopping available and even smoking lounges for those so inclined. However they took a fantastic concept design with wide open hallways for moving people from place to place then: 1) Dropped a shopping mall in the middle - you cannot get from place to place quickly as you are dodging all the retail customers browsing the shelves. 2) Added retail kiosks to the already congested walkways. 3) Poor signage if you have to transition to another terminal upon arrival. Get ready to be lost first time travelers of Terminal 3. 4) No fast transit to Terminal 1, I had to assist a very elderly lady myself to ensure she made the 20 min walk to her new gate after she got off my flight. 5) Limited Washrooms - don't leave it to the last minute here folks as they are hard to find and normally have a lineup when you do eventually get there.

What needs work, the A and B-concourses, which are EK-dedicated, are now too crowded, even after midnight, and the overall effect is somewhat claustrophobic.

I have to agree with the point made by an earlier reviewer about the security checkpoints, I fail to see the need for it as passengers have alighted from their plane into a secure area to board another plane without any outside contact.

The disabled lounge was a nice place to wait for the 3 hours while we were transitting there. My partner and I were even allowed to go to a different floor which actually had a smoking room.

In addition, they have the longest queue and waiting time for arrival.

Dubai,"We transited twice this month with 3 - 4 hour layovers from 10 pm - 3 am. Dubai Airport is nice and has great facilities including restaurants and duty free. But two problems - because of it's size it's necessary to take a bus from the tarmac to the main terminal (A in our case) and this trip can take between 20 minutes and half an hour. Far too long - this seemed like an airport tour to us. And the second issue is security. After getting off a long flight and before even going to the WC, one has to spend 15 minutes going through security after a flight which seems ridiculous given that one just has gone through security before getting on a plane. It seems like overkill. One final note - nice to get vouchers for food for layovers longer than 3 hours. Other airports don't do this. Finally Singapore definitely seems the better airport compared to Dubai - less security , shorter tarmac transit times, and carpeting throughout the terminal give it to edge.",7,Transit,February 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,4,3,4,4,5,4,4

The display boards for the departures are rather unnerving as they move flights around very quickly from one board to the next. One area of complaint is the limited number of toilets and those that were available were not very clean.

I had to walk half an hour back to another lounge and then return again two hours before departure. There were no signs of a trolley and directions of A,B and C are misleading.

Queuing for toilets and an unpleasant free recreational area with not enough space, long walks to change planes, unfriendly airport staff, even mineral water bought after the security check was not allowed to take on the plane to Sydney (Emirates/Qantas code share flight) because there was an unexpected second manual check directly at the gate. For what was the first security check for? We will avoid Dubai airport in the future if possible.",4,Arrival and Departure,January 2016,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,1,4,4,4,4,2
Dubai,"Last December while flying from Paris to Johannesburg I made stopover at Dubai (DXB) airport. I found that the airport was very well organized and that it was almost impossible to get lost.

Dubai,"T2 in Dubai a few years back used to be quite dirty and unpleasant. In the last three years it has been totally refurbished into a completely new premises and the current one is a very nice, clean premises. Good thing is that it is functional, hospitable, yet short walks to access and to exit which for short trip is a gift which makes it my preferred terminal when flying for short trips.",10,Departure Only,January 2016,Business,Departure Only,5,4,5,5,5,4,5
Dubai,"Arrived in Terminal 1 on a busy Thursday night, with plenty of long-haul arrivals from the Far East and Europe, two Saudi Arabia flights, a full Boeing 777-300ER from Doha (my flight), plus the usual India/Pakistan flights. It was very busy, with thousands of passengers walking towards passport control via the underground tunnel. Passport control was a huge mess, which has been the case for several years now. There are 2 different types of queues-a few for 'GCC Nationals', and 'Other Nationalities.' Given that 90% of the population are not GCC citizens, not a very efficient allocation of resources. Lumping the 'others' together is big mistake, as there are no lines for UAE Residents (who are fastest to process), UAE visitors, and those entering for work/residence (each category needs to be processed differently). Ridiculous thing is, lines for E-Gate were very, very long. Having just a few machines may have worked back in 2003 when only a few savvy frequent travellers signed up for them, but the reality is any Dubai resident 18 and above who travels more than twice a year probably has E-gate now. Was a 15/20 minute wait to go through. Saw a Lebanese family (mother had E-gate but husband and infant did not) try to go through the adjacent immigration booth, but were rudely turned away by the officer and told to join the back of the very long regular queues. As a courtesy E-gate card holders' dependents are usually let through. Very impolite and shows how there is no system in place for young/elderly/infirm travellers. This is in contrast to Terminal 3, where there is Smart Gate, and E-Gate, and dedicated lines for UAE residents. Baggage claim hall was very busy and no monitors displaying which flight was assigned to which belt. T1's chaos has become normal and management seems somewhat complacent. In short, avoid arriving in Terminal 1, as unless your flight happens to land outside a busy arrival bank, you could be waiting for 90 minutes just to pass through passport control.",5,Arrival Only,January 2016,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,3,3,3,4,3,1,2
Dubai,I had great expectations for this airport which were not met. We flew in from Paris in business class on Emirates on an A380 and departed on Singapore Airlines also in business. Arrived around midnight and it took us about 1 hour to get to our chauffeur. Lines were long and staff did not appear to be in a hurry. Luggage still had not arrived by the time we cleared immigration. Only positive is that Terminal 3 is new and clean. By contrast Terminal 1 is old and not well lit. There is no express line for business class passengers and at 5.00pm the lines were long. Again the staff were in no hurry. From the time we arrived took over an hour to get to the Lufthansa lounge which Singapore Airlines used. After this experience could not be bothered to do any duty free shopping and waited till Changi.,2,Arrival and Departure,January 2016,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,2,3,0,N/A,1,1
Dubai,"We landed in a remote parking bay after a 10 hour long haul flight. The bus ride to the terminal took 25 min. The bus dropped us in a secondary screening area that seemed infrequently used. After exiting we had to make a choice as to which terminal to go to B or C. Despite waiting for the tv screens to cycle through multiple screens, because our transit waiting time (4 hours) was longer than the number of flights they could display, they did not indicate which way we should walk. Although well advertised the stroller facility was empty. We had two toddlers so wanted to be sure we walked to the correct terminal. We then tried the interactive kiosk, but it also did not have our connecting flight details. We then tried to find a staff member - unlike other airports they are hard to locate at the transit connections point. When we did the advice was ""sit on the floor and wait an hour until the details are available - as there were no chairs."" We eventually flipped a coin and went one way. We were flying business class and went to the lounge. There were long queues for the men's toilets on the lounge and the facilities were dirty despite there being a person there to arrange the towels. In an odd choice of spatial planning, the kids play area in the lounge in only accessible by walking through the smoking lounge. On a separate point there is no separation of air between the smoking or non smoking area. I have travelled through many airports, but I will go out of my way to avoid this one in the future.",3,Transit,January 2016,Family Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,4,3,1
Dubai,"As a resident of Dubai, I am a frequent user of Dubai International airport which regrettably is now beginning to suffer from the same issues that London Heathrow used to be known for. I arrived back from our Christmas holiday in the UK via Heathrow (which incidentally was great) to experience a 2 hour queue for immigration on arrival at Dubai Airport's Terminal 1. Unable to use the e gate facility as we had a 3 year old with us, we had to stand and watch the relatively chaotic queue management system cope with the hordes of arriving passengers. I accept that this may have been one of the busiest periods for the airport but what was difficult to fathom was the lack of any other processing facilities for those of us who are resident in the country outside of e gates. There was only one man in a military uniform who seemed to be involved in queue management and there were so many people around no one could make out what he was saying. As the airport has become busier, its ability to organize passengers effectively seems to have dipped whilst paradoxically London Heathrow has now become a pleasure to pass through. Come on Dubai - lets get back to poll position.",4,Arrival Only,December 2015,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,3,2,2,3,3,3,2
Dubai,"This airport is huge! However, the instructions to get around were usually good. We found our way to the departure lounge easy but the only thing we found difficult was that every section looks the same. You think you have just done a big circle and it did become a bit confusing. Also, there was a lack of departure and arrival boards. The bathrooms were constantly busy so you would have to wait a while. Other than that, the airport was clean, well communicated and the staff usually pretty helpful.",7,Arrival and Departure,June 2015,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,2,4,3,5,2,4
Dubai,This has to be the worst airport! After arriving from a 7 hour flight we had to endure a 30min bus ride back to the terminal. For some reason our bus driver just stayed parked by the plane for 15 min while we stood up in a overly crowded bus. Once you arrive at the terminal you are forced to go through security which is unorganized to say the least. Once through security we had to take a train to another terminal. Someone really needs to do a better job designing this airport. Once we made it to our gate we realized the lack of seating. We ended up walking back to the middle of the terminal to find a seat. I usually fly business class but this time I brought my family with so we got to enjoy Emirates economy treatment. What a joke. I will never fly Emirates again.,1,Transit,December 2015,Business,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Dubai,"After a long flight in an elderly Emirates 777-200 from Perth Australia I was looking forward to some comfort in transit. The first impression was ""sterile"". It became clear that persons without access to the lounges were not well catered for. The cost of a cup of coffee and a small cakes was outrageous. The signage was inadequate and it was not obvious without asking that to board the next flight to Rome involved a train ride to another part of this vast impersonal airport. I will not fly Emirates again.",3,Transit,September 2015,Family Leisure,Transit,4,1,2,1,N/A,N/A,2
Dubai,"Dubai is basking in glowing reports about how enjoyable and comfortable their facilities are. Where there is lots of sun there is shade. The first one is the parking policy of EK. Why are dozens of a/c parked far from the terminal with long bus journeys back to where you should be? Why is the security check so chaotic for the massive numbers of passengers at peak times? Transiting with EK can be a pleasure even given the previous concerns. Please note, never change to a non EK carrier, first you will not find the transfer facility and when you do, it is a small window in the wall with no comfort around. It seems that EK wants to discourage changing to any other airline.",5,Transit,November 2015,Couple Leisure,Transit,4,2,4,2,4,N/A,3
Dubai,"I had the opportunity to arrive and also to depart from this huge airport. The airport is quite big and this terminal was totally reserved for Emirates. You always have the sensation of open space and of lots natural light. I was just a bit disappointed with queues at check-in, security and passport control. In the waiting area for all Economy passengers there are lots of shops and cafes. The arrival experience was also good. We proceed very fast through passport control and soon received our luggage (it all took about 20-30 minutes).",8,Arrival and Departure,April 2015,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,5,4
Dubai,"This airport has an extra security check for transfer passengers. At two consecutive times (at Fri 1.15am and Sat 5.45am) we found the checkpoints to be badly organized. The first time the fast lane was missing for first/business class passengers. The second time (with crowd management missing and a lack of crowd barriers) we had to go with the crowd for 10 minutes before we could reach the fast lane (see picture). Employees didn't appear to been trained for customer friendliness. On one check my luggage was kept separate because of a deodorant can (complying with all safety rules, 75ml in a transparent releasable bag, separately placed in the tray), which was confiscated. Because there was quite a backlog of 'not-ok luggage items' I had to wait 10 minutes in a cramped space with too many people. I had to struggle to stay there. No-one was apparently in charge and the employees were too busy chatting with each other. Signage at this airport is confusing and inadequate. Flight information on the screens is presented in a confusing way. There is a large amount of shops, but sales employees don't appear to be motivated. It's impressive, the sheer size and the amount of glass and marble in terminal 3, but it's sterile. With money you just can't buy quality and a nice atmosphere. But because of my bad experience and because of the rude behaviour of the employees, I prefer to avoid this airport in the future.",1,Transit,December 2015,Couple Leisure,Transit,3,2,1,2,3,3,1
Dubai,"We flew to Dubai on our way to Abu Dhabi and I was quite excited to see Dubai airport, after all the episodes that I saw of Ultimate Airports. To begin with, it is very huge and spans acres. The three elongated concourses see multiple airlines from across the world vying for a gate. Unfortunately, our Emirates flight arrived late at Dubai airport and was allocated a remote gate at the far end of the airport. The bus ride from the aircraft to the main terminal, zig-zagging through internal roads took us almost 15 minutes. The immigration clearance was quite smooth, but the officers seemed to be enjoying chatting amongst themselves. What really set the temperatures soaring was the amount of time the luggage took to come to the conveyor belt. We werent actually surprised, since we ourselves took some time to reach the terminal. Thanks to all this mess, we ended up missing our connecting bus to Abu Dhabi. While departing Dubai airport, since we ended up arriving quite early (and had checked in online) we had an ample time to loiter around. The formalities took us not more than 30 minutes and we were off to explore Concourse B of Terminal 3. The duty free shopping is something to look out for. The terminal itself is very big and walking through all the gates will give you a good exercise before boarding the flight. The boarding happens at the lower floor than the main departures floor. A little confusion did happen during boarding, but was sorted out pretty fast. Luckily, our flight this time took off on time, but not before taxing across half the terminal and the main runway.",6,Arrival and Departure,December 2015,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,3,4,4,5,3,3
Dubai,"Landing in Terminal 3 Dubai Airport was nice. I was able to go through customs easily and with no wait because my plane happened to be one of the only ones there. I got my bags quickly and I was on my way into the city center after catching a taxi outside the airport. Leaving, I was able to go through passport control again quite easily. There was good signage and staff happy to help. The duty free shops had a nice selection of designer items and souvenirs reasonably priced.

There is plenty of seating in departures area, comfy lounges where you can strech your legs and have a nap during long waits like ours. There are pleanty of food outlets which you can choose from, from regional kitchens to international fast food chains. Prices are reasonable. The staff at the airport are very helpful and polite. Would recommend the Marhaba Lounge situated in Terminal 3 which offers plenty of comfy seats. The food and beverage offering has plenty to offer. Security at the airport is very efficient and quick.

Dubai,"After a long haul flight, was looking forward to a restful four hour break at the Dubai International Airport but the first thing that put me off was a long flight of steps down into an overcrowded bus that takes more than 20 minutes to reach the terminal. Not expected of an international airport. No aerobridge and nobody to help a senior citizen like me to climb up and down the steps. Requested assistance to climb but was refused! Then the horror began - busloads of passengers herded at the security counters - long lines and chaotic. Might help if there are separate lines for older people. A trip to the washroom was again very off-putting - filthy, smelly loos with long lines. Despite the fact that an attendant was standing there, two loos were closed and the rest were not being cleaned. The breakfast voucher got me a sandwich but no cold drink as one culd only get coffee or tea. Picked up a glass of fresh orange juice for $7! The shopping was nothing to write home about and was just stacked and overflowing counters of dates and baklava. All overpriced. In all, I would avoid Dubai airport in the future.",3,Transit,August 2015,Solo Leisure,Transit,1,2,3,2,2,3,3
Dubai,"Spent several hours in transit on flight to and from Singapore. Airport staff, shop staff, restaurant staff were generally unfreindly or at least careless. Seating facilities extremely poor, too little seats for too many tired passengers waiting. Many people had to sit on the floor. Transportation by bus from airplane to terminal was very long and hardly any seats on the busses. Choice of restaurants poor. Apparently this is an airport constructed only for people to spend money in duty free, but even that seemed uninspiring with the same careless and unfriendly attitude of staff and the shops average and boring.",1,Transit,October 2015,Business,Transit,2,1,3,1,2,N/A,1

Departure from DOH was late and therefore arrival was also late. I have 1 hr and 25 minutes to make it to my next flight, which is fine because I know the airport pretty well. However, when we landed, passengers for certain flights (I presume with MCT) were told to stand on the side as we were going to be taken to our gates directly via coaster bus. Been flying EK for 5 years on the regular now and this is a first. We were brought to our terminal not even with a COBUS, but a tiny coaster. I'm not kidding. I had to literally run to my gate and had to tell the ground staff, their MCT is not sustainable at all. I was out of breathe, tired and irritated. All in all, if you're flying with EK, ensure your transit time is at least 2 hours so you won't be literally put off your holiday mood.",3,Transit,September 2015,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,2,4,3,3,1,3

We had an issue with a ""free"" stay over that went horribly wrong and no body at the airport tried to solve and didn't seem to care at all. They were dismissive. It is overcrowded as far too many flight seem to arrive in the early morning and disgorge thousands of passengers within a short period. There are huge lengthy queues for immigration if you decide to spend a few days while transiting who are unfriendly, and indeed surly. I had to get a wheel chair (broken ankle two days previously) the last time and this was not pleasant. The guy pushing me didn't seem to notice the thousands of other passengers. Many a time I had to get my cast ankle out of the way of a bang - which would have been seriously painful.

In Dubai you are expected to walk from the plane to a buggy at the arrival gate this takes you to the (East) Transfer Desk where you are expected to disembark and walk through the security check, walk to and take a lift to the next floor and then walk to another buggy. This second buggy will take you to the departure gate of your next flight from where you are expected to walk to the cabin entrance. A wheelchair will not be provided of these stages unless you insist in the strong manner and even then you will have to wait 10-15 minutes while they find one.

Abu Dhabi,Not Verified |  This is a very modern airport but they have not thought through all details. There is no place for a non premium tired traveler to stretch their legs and relax. Many of the other supports I've been at have a reclining chair with possibility to stretch legs. Not all of us can afford the lounge or the on sure hotel. 130 usd for 4 hours! Also there are not enough phone and computer charging capabilities in this modern airport. Very disappointed.,6,Transit,January 2025,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,2,5,4,4,5,3

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified |  On 10th of June I had a connection flight from Abu Dhabi to London at 2pm at gate D43. As I knew there was an additional security check at the gate and it had never been pleasant but this time it was enough uncomfortable to me therefore i decided to share my experience. I was searched by a female security officer and her professionalism was questionable. Her First question was about my mental health. When I answered positively, she laughed. She did my fully body check without asking me about permission. For a whole time she treated me as a suspect not as a customer. She asked me about sharp items and box matches with a joyable voice. She found even my period products very suspicious as well, having a lot of fun in meantime. I had a few security checks before her that day already and a flight. She left me with anxiety level until the roof wishing me a ""good day"".

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have been transiting through this airport for over a decade, during which it has been steadily going downhill. Terminal 1 has spectacular dome architecture and a good variety of cafes. Unfortunately, the quantity of flights transiting through Abu Dhabi means that virtually all now pass through the utilitarian and uninspired Terminal 3. Transiting through this terminal means a long walk from disembarkation to security, then an even longer walk to the next gate. Security check is always jam-packed with long queues in a small area. At least the screening machines are sophisticated (laptops can stay in cases) and security personnel are mostly good-humoured. However, Terminal 3 is not a pleasant place to wait between flights: there are few eating and drinking facilities in evidence. This time we made the mistake of investigating the Al Dhabi Lounge but found it to be overcrowded and dirty.",4,Transit,October 2023,Couple Leisure,Transit,3,3,4,1,1,N/A,2

Ineffective information system with flights listed from midnight rather than current time, T3 airport map on website is outdated/incorrect, loudspeaker announcements are often incomprehensible and careless.

Abu Dhabi,Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi terminal 1 is extremely congested. In times of a pandemic it is a scary experience and there is a shortage of seating at the gates.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Abu Dhabi airport is very badly designed. The signage is not proper. It does not have enough gates for direct boarding and most of the time, you are transported by a bus to the aircraft. (Which may take 10 to 15 minutes). If the climate is too bad in Abu Dhabi, you get exposed to that. The temperature was 14 degrees centigrade and none of us had winter clothing. There are very few water fountains and you are forced to buy water. Washrooms are also not enough. There is a transit hotel, which is much cheaper than Dubai, that is a plus point. Duty free shops are not well distributed and many of the items, available at Dubai (like spices) are not available here. Some of the food outlets, do not accept foreign currency, not even USD. The security takes a lot of time. Very few machines are operating even if there is a big queue. When I was there, they stopped the escalator as there was no space!",7,Arrival and Departure,February 2020,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
Abu Dhabi,✅ Trip Verified | Nice but crowded airport. I landed here in the early hours of the morning and already Departures was crowded. As a result there was very little seating and the food outlets were very busy. The airport is nice and Terminal 3 is nicely arranged and sign posted. At the rate that they are going they need to expand faster.,8,Transit,January 2020,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,2,4,3,4,N/A,3
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Can Abu Dhabi Airport seriously and seriously get their new Terminal open now? I’ve been waiting and I thought it should have just open back at that time when I was already there last year. What shocks up until now it has not open at all. Seriously? People have been so tired of your airport and Etihad for offering service like this. Old Terminal, Terminal and facilities start to feel like 50 years ago and this is not a year like this? It’s already 2020 and you and Etihad cannot handle customers complaints and opinions on your own airport and airline. The lounge in Terminal 3 of Etihad is still good, but Terminal 1 is awful. Compared to other airports worldwide including New Istanbul Airport (TK), Changi Singapore (SQ) and most other major airports WW including Dubai (EK). Why can’t Abu Dhabi Airport do better than these airports now? What’s the problem with your new terminal delayed? And worst, Etihad service is worse than major airlines as well. I will never fly Etihad and will not return to AUH until their new terminal is ready. Next time when I get to AUH when the new terminal is complete, I will use other airlines instead of Etihad. I hope Abu Dhabi Airport new terminal open sooner as of this year and I hope that it will be better than this. On the positive side, the WI-FI is fast and the staff is good. The duty-free is also good. This is also Etihad fault for causing drama at this airport and that makes me the reason not to fly Etihad again.",6,Transit,July 2019,Family Leisure,Transit,1,3,3,0,5,5,5
Abu Dhabi,"Not Verified |  Airport is too small for the amount of traffic it receives. Terminals are outdated and in need of upgrade. Layout is impractical. No flow through.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Transfer security is pure horror in the early morning hours, took 30-45 mins in a giant crowd in a long walkway without seeing the end.

Long, narrow, twisted walkways, confusing airport layout, insufficient and confusing signs.",4,Transit,January 2020,Couple Leisure,Transit,3,2,2,0,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"Not Verified |  Transiting through this airport was the worst thing that could have happened to me. The 2 times I landed here, the security screening was horribly overcrowded and no efforts were made to fastrack the process. Oddly enough, both the times we faced the exact same scenario, wonder if the authorities are aware of this clogging. The cherry on the cake was, the AC wasn't functional on a pretty warm night which made this whole experience a nightmare. Etihad is going to miss out on quite a few passengers if this issue isn't fixed which is a shame for a reputed airline.",3,Arrival and Departure,December 2019,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,2,2,3,0,1,1,1
Abu Dhabi,✅ Trip Verified | This airport is just too small to support volumes. 3 out of my 4 flights were to/from a remote gate and this just takes up time. On top of that there was no priority security screening which again adds time. That said the buses were always waiting though on one of the transfers we sat there for 20 mins before leaving with doors open and a 34 degree day. Was travelling at a quiet time of year so the airport itself was quiet but at peak periods you can’t move freely around. New airport looks great and would hope there are less transiting problems when this opens. Shops are a bit limited. Would have expected far more options.,5,Transit,October 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,N/A,3,0,2,3,3
Abu Dhabi,"Not Verified |  
Claustrophobic and dizzying airport. Who’s great idea was it to put everything inside a circle. Terrible layout and architecture. The only good thing is the passive transit security. No problem transiting sealed wine bottles in my carry-on.",2,Transit,October 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,1,2,1,1,4,3
Abu Dhabi,Not Verified |  As usual arriving anytime after 7.30pm night time this place is severely overcrowded - for some reason we arrived at T1 yet on an Etihad Flight you should disembark at T3? At least we were lucky no bus. T1 security seems more efficient than T3 so was through this in around 5 minutes which is unusual here .. there is no fast track or business class lane here so be warned if you are a business class passenger .. then you have a walk to T3 which is fine but the air conditioning doesn’t work so the heat is still felt here on this walk. When arriving at T3 you just get hit with an overcrowded terminal with masses of people everywhere..... again using the toilets at gate 58 area it’s still well clean & no waiting. At this end of the terminal it’s less crowded with good working air conditioning so I waited for my connecting flight here.,3,Transit,September 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,2,2,0,N/A,3,1
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | This airport became a mess in the morning at the time I think most of the international flights arrived. Shoes were supposed to be taken off at security check. Pathetic. Terminal 1 is particularly awful. Repugnant smell, over crowded and small. Once you enter T3 you feel like breathing again untill you reach the ground floor concourse which is again pitiful with insufficient seating space and gates too congested.

Abu Dhabi,Not Verified |  Possibly the worst international airport I have been through: Courtesy = 1/10 Scanning = 3/10 Restaurants = 0/10 Organisation = 1/10 Chaos = 10/10. Couldn’t wait to get on the plane.,2,Transit,July 2019,Family Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,3,1
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | I travel a lot between Europe and Pacific Asia. Second time I transited through Abu Dhabi Airport and this was by far my worst experience in a so called ""modern"" airport: overcrowded airport, endless bus rides to and from the plane, disorganised and unfriendly staff, endless queues for security check, and even to go to the men's rooms (which are not that clean), lines, crowed, lines, lines, lines, even hard to know which lines goes to which gate! With so many poeple walking everywhere! 2 hours is very short for a tansit because such a poorly managed airport. First time I was in that airport it was a bit less busy but staff for security check at the gate was quite rude. A place to avoid when you have so many better options.",2,Transit,July 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,1,2,2,N/A,N/A,1
Abu Dhabi,✅ Trip Verified |  Arriving reasonably early from Melbourne at T3 which sadly we were as is the norm bused once again from a major destination from a faraway area & we must have got very lucky as the security control for transit passengers was virtually empty so it was a breeze of only 2 minutes to get through and done! At this time in the morning you can at least walk around the airport unhampered. I used the toilets next to gate 35 & they were clean & not crowded with passengers despite the gate being in use. WiFi here was awful though this time & just hanged for several minutes & sometimes disconnecting - early morning before 7.30am this airport is easy to move around but after that it’s back to being overcrowded with many morning flights scheduled to leave. Hoping the new airport when open is more spacious.,5,Transit,June 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,3,2,0,N/A,1,2
Abu Dhabi,"❎ Not Verified | Transit chaos during Ramadan as usual with only 3 X-ray machines operating & huge queues with more passengers arriving so quickly. As an Etihad Guest Gold Member you can avail of the fast track lane through security at the transit, but sadly it was poorly manned & complete misdirections by security staff & it was a free for all for all passengers. Truly dreadful transit experience by totally inept security personnel, at least the toilets near to gate 58 were still clean & actually manned by janitors & relatively quiet. This transiting experience has become a major issue at this Airport for so many passengers & nothing is done. All the X-ray machines should be open during what was becoming peak period of planes arriving with so many passengers transiting but poor airport management here ensures passengers continue to have bad experiences with huge queues so tight connections could be missed because of waiting.",2,Arrival Only,May 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,1,2,2,0,N/A,2,1
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified |  No queues at security checks, barely enough staff to handle customers, and those staff who were available were clearly untrained. One particular 'security' staff (not the customs staff but rather others employed by Etihad/the airport, can see them wearing black suits) started to push me around while screaming at me because I simply because I asked him if I'll miss my connecting flight because my inbound flight was delayed. Not the best airport experience when you're publicly humiliated and screamed at. The airport in general still uses airstairs, even for their long-haul flights which is a bummer because this means getting to and from the gate to the plane will take around 30 mins or so on average.",1,Transit,May 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,3,1,0,3,N/A,1

Abu Dhabi,Not Verified | Arriving from Bahrain and as usual bus from plane to terminal. This time at transit security there was a very pleasent security guy who was courteous and polite! So nice when you get someone who is well mannered. A tip if you want to find a clean toilet as I discovered is near to gates 58-61 there are two lots of toilets down stairs that are clean and only used when gates are in use. Try to go here while a gate is reasonably empty and you will have a good clean toilet experience. Even better than an overcrowded business lounge. Trouble free transit this time around even though it’s very crowded at night time..WiFi was pretty good reliable connection away from the main central area where duty free shops are.,5,Transit,September 2018,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,2,2,3,N/A,3,3
Abu Dhabi,"Not Verified |  Arriving from Melbourne a major city we were once again herded to the outer reaches of this airport where we had to use buses. As we were on an Etihad flight normally the bus driver drops you at T3 but for some reason this driver decided we’d be dropped off at T1! This meant a long walk to get to T3 & there were a few older folk who I know had connecting flights out of T3 so they’d have to endure a long walk. Not what you need first thing early morning arrival after 14hrs on a flight. The plus was that transiting was quick through security so quickly through here. On departure for flight to Bahrain the boarding process was totally chaotic, only 1 ground staff & 2 lines of passengers & here there was no such thing as business class or priority boarding it was a free for all, dreadful and totally disorganized, buses once again out to the nether regions of the airport to the plane. The Airport early morning is a lot less crowded than night time thankfully so you could get to use a toilet which are relatively clean because at night time they are filthy so obviously cleaned only in the morning. It’s still an airport that you are really glad to leave behind though.",4,Arrival and Departure,August 2018,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,2,1,3,0,N/A,3,2
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Once again you are shuttled from the plane by bus to the drop off transfer arrival point where you weave a myriad of roads which are very busy. Transit at this old airport is always a nightmare but I must have got lucky as the security check wasn’t too crowded, but you still had to run the gauntlet of security staff who really don’t want to be there doing their jobs with many busy with the smart phones as is the case these days. Toilets are still dreadful and should be avoided, there’s just too many people in such a small area and you are always glad when you board you flight and even that is disorganized.",3,Transit,July 2018,Solo Leisure,Transit,1,2,2,0,N/A,2,1
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Avoid at all costs. Abu Dhabi airpoirt is both an old and chaotic airport. Quite simply an unpleasant place to be. It is very hard to navigate around, and involves long walks between the gates you need to walk to for your connecting flights. Furthermore it is overcrowded, hot and chaotic. Transitting in Abu Dhabi is a very stressful experience. More often than not, your plane will not even stop at a gate. Instead you have to disembark on the runway and take an airport bus to the gate. The customs and security personnel are rude and unfriendly. The lounges are miles away from the gates.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified |  Expensive. Seriously. The prices are hiked to such an exorbitant amount, it’s really not worth purchasing anything here. Design of the airport is flawed. They should expand for space. It’s crammed with so many things that it makes the airport look smaller than it already is - staff is rude.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Perhaps the most plaintive thing is experiencing an 11-hour layover in this cold airport without bringing any long-sleeve coat. I’m transferring from China, a sub-tropical country, to Oman, a tropical country. How am I supposed to know I should bring my down jacket with me?! And don’t laugh, as I’m not exaggerating for one bit. I saw passengers wearing down jackets, scarves, and layers of pullovers. And how I envy them! I basically wear all my three T-shirts and still freeze to death, thinking I might end up with hyperthermia. Walking in the aisle gives me goose bumps that won’t go away. Yes I know it’s quite scorching here during summer, but do you have to air-con the place to make it feel like the Arctic?",1,Transit,June 2018,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,2,3,1,3,4,1
Abu Dhabi,"❌ Not Verified |  Very poor airport design. Having arrived from Kuala Lumpur en route to London, it took an unbelievavsble 45 minutes from wheels touch down to reaching the transit lounge (due to long taxi time from landing to aircraft parking, then bus ride in the heat to terminal building, then security queue and finally a painfully long walk to the business class terminal). There is only one toilet to be shared across all business class passengers. actually there are two toilet if you include the disabled toilet.

Abu Dhabi,"❌ Not Verified |  As a 22 year old college grad who has spent the past few years living in squalor, my expectations for air travel aren't very high. That being said, I'm pretty disappointed with Abu Dhabi's airport. Before I begin, it's worth noting that I'm writing this in the midst of a 8 hour layover, which probably isn't helping my mood. A few of the other reviews complained about the humidity, which personally I don't have an issue with - the facility is well enough conditioned to avoid heat stroke. To make things simple, I'll list pros and cons from my experience today. Pros: Good wifi. The massage I got was actually pretty decent. Fast queue times (just kidding, I still have a few hours before I find out if that happens for sure). Cons: 45 minute massage cost 105 USD. Very average ramen noodle + beef cost 17 USD. Poor airport design (I've had easier times navigating labyrinths). The tables in the smoking lounge are falling apart. Cigarettes only available by the carton. No alcohol in the daytime (to be fair, this was due to a religious holiday). The employees aren't very helpful, I was looking for the sleeping pods that were advertised on the website, after walking around for 30-40 minutes with several employees pointing me in several different directions, I eventually discovered that the sleeping pods were no longer in the airport. Tips to Abu Dhabi: Give each traveler a map + crayon when they get off their flight. Lower your food prices or hire flame jugglers to entertain me while I eat your sub par noodles. Sell cigarettes by the pack. Bring back the sleeping pods.",5,Transit,May 2018,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,3,2,2,3,5,2
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Hot and humid. Overcrowded. Staff have no idea how to deal with travelers. Worst of all, and most troubling, security is incomplete. I witnessed the following: Passengers setting off the metal detector but not being searched. Not passing bags through the x-ray machine. When I tried to raise concerns with the staff I was abruptly told to move on. Indeed I set off the metal detector but no one searched me. How is this level of incompetence allowed by IATA? Will not use this hub again.",1,Arrival and Departure,May 2018,Business,Arrival and Departure,1,N/A,2,0,N/A,1,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | 
So the main issue with Abu Dhabi Airport is the humidity. It's such a basic thing you the airport designers would get it right, but they haven't. The actual air temperature is fine, but it's like walking through a very cold soupy swamp. They do have functioning air conditioning units, but they seem to be reserved for the airline lounges (where I'm writing this review from). Other than that, there's very little shopping or food available near the gates themselves which is a pain, and the wifi in the main airport area is almost unusable.",4,Transit,May 2018,Business,Transit,4,3,4,3,4,2,4

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified |  After using Doha and Dubai airports in the region I had hoped Abu Dhabi might at least come close. What a joke.

Abu Dhabi,❎ Not Verified |  Knowing that this is one of the main transit hubs I had really high expectations but I was left in shock how dated this airport actually is. I had a flight transfer here and the first thing you have to go through is a security check which is then repeated at the gate meaning that if your layover is short you could miss a flight. The airport corridors and shops are narrow and under huge pressure from millions of passengers. Absolutely the worst part are the toilet facilities which are extremely scarce and dirty. In general the facilities offered for passengers in transit are subpar. If you wish to sit down you have to enter the gate zone as outside of it there are only a few chairs available in the corridors. The staff I came in contact with were really nice.,3,Arrival and Departure,March 2018,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1,1,2,0,1,N/A,5

Abu Dhabi,"❎ Not Verified |  Very unhelpful. It was 2 am and one of my kids was asleep and they kicked us out of the seating area, lined everyone up to check their tickets. We sat my son in the next seating area over. My husband lined up and texted me when he got to the front of the line. The man checking tickets saw me struggling with my sleeping child and had me sit him in the original seating area apologizing saying people with kids don’t have to wait in line. However he did nothing to warn the other parents. So we went down the line telling all the parents ourselves. The ticket man also said to sit near the entrance as they would announce people with kids to board. When the time came they boarded wheelchair users and let economy riders on at the same time as business class (who were very upset). I confronted a stewardess asking why they haven’t announced business class or people with kids. She just said your in the kids line, look their are lots of you. I wasn’t in a line really I was standing with business class and a few people with kids. I saw another attendant and asked him. He suggested we all sit down. I got upset and said so you want to board everyone else first and then let people with kids on last, that’s useless. He got angry and asked me what do I want. He told me to stand where I was and enter with business class. The whole thing was strange. I have never experienced anything like this at an airport. There are basic standards but no one seems to know what they are. Very unprofessional.",2,Departure Only,January 2018,Family Leisure,Departure Only,5,4,5,4,N/A,5,1
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | Abu Dhabi airport is becoming more and more painful to travel through. The staff there are rude. Etihad Airways religiously wants to ensure your carry on luggage fits to the stainless steel cage they have at the airport even though I had already traveled my first leg of the journey from Chicago to Abu Dhabi. For some reason, Etihad did not give me a boarding pass to my connecting flight which was also Etihad from Abu Dhabi to Lahore. I had to go to the transfer desk and be in the queue for 30 minutes to get a boarding pass. This airport has outsourced all the services to contracting companies. Everywhere I found unskilled labor doing work including baggage handling through the scanners.",4,Transit,December 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,2,2,2,2,2,2

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | It does not compare to Dubai, a place of such efficiency, it would be very difficult to beat. My concern about this airport is the heavy presence of unlicensed and illegal taxi touts. A year ago these individuals were clustered at the doorways. Now, imbued with a sense of complete freedom from action from any officials, they are right inside and no more than five paces after you step out from Customs. There was one fraught security official who professed he could not manage the crowd of around 25 of these men. Anyone slightly western looking is pounced on. I asked to see a permit. They could not provide. They quote outrageous prices thinking you will be ignorant of the real rates. What did shift some of them? I got out the camera and took a few pictures. They ran but two minutes later they were back. Then they decided to locate up at the other exit. There was one empty police car. No officers. I did try to locate them unsuccessfully. There are no warning posters anywhere. Nobody gives you a leaflet inside the Arrivals Hall that provides correct information. There is not enough security and even Customer Services say they cannot deal with it. So this 'mafia' operate with impunity. Down in Dubai there are police and they arrest and deport that day these taxi touts, many of whom are not legally in the country anyway. There does not seem to be any determination to act yet the capital wants tourists. I agree with other reviewers: the toilets are inadequate. However, this is as much to do with the poor cultural habits of the users as the paucity of toilets.",5,Arrival and Departure,December 2017,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,2,3,3,2,3,N/A,2
Abu Dhabi,✅ Trip Verified | Arrival: immigration procedures very efficient: less than 20 minutes are necessary from aircraft disembarcation to airport exit. Departure: check in and immigration procedures are efficient. Waiting area in international area is a little too small for a B777-300ER (gate 7 - Terminal 1).

Abu Dhabi,"❎ Unverified |  
Don't Like this airport for the following reasons: 1) Signage is confusing and there are too many twists and turns. 2) The departure gates and times are often changed at the last minute without warning. I almost missed my flight because of this. 3) They station staff at certain points who point you in directions where you did not intend to go and mislead you. 4) The entrance for departures is located at the side as an afterthought almost and you enter into a narrow passage as if its still work in progress! 5) Offiicial staff are not friendly and rather brusque. They haven't seemed to have overcome their inbuilt superiority complex. 6) Not as efficient as Dubai where everything is superbly laid out and accessible. 7) When we reached the departure lounge, we were not let in and passengers were all hanging around outside with nowhere to sit or eat.",4,Arrival and Departure,February 2017,Business,Arrival and Departure,4,2,2,3,3,N/A,2
Abu Dhabi,✅ Verified Review |  I had to transit through this airport on my return flight to Australia. On the way out we nearly got stuck on a moving escalator as the transit security was so backed up. The member of staff at the top of the stairs wasn't doing anything to stop the situation. In the end a passenger hit the emergency stop button to prevent injury. On the return journey as we went through the transit security they decided the wine bottle stopper I had purchased as a gift in Sydney city was not allowed through this airport - yet it was fine to go through Sydney security. The man was very rude to me and didn't even explain why I couldn't take it through. It was just a standard wine bottle stopper in a gift box so not an offensive weapon of any kind! There should be no need for transit security and also they open and check your bags again when you go through to the boarding gate! The security staff in particular were very abrupt and rude which is a complete contrast to the polite staff of the many other airports I have travelled to and through.,3,Transit,November 2017,Family Leisure,Transit,4,4,4,0,N/A,4,1
Abu Dhabi,"❎ Unverified |  So, my expectations were low. I read numerous reviews on here prior to leaving and was dreading the transit process as I was travelling alone with an active 2 year old in tow. Well, I needn't have worried because my experience was fine. Firstly I transited at night twice (apparently the busiest time) and on both occasions it was not crowded. Baby cars were readily available and greatly helped me in getting the little one where she needed to be with minimal fuss. The security queue was quickly bypassed when the staff noticed I was travelling with a child. In any case the queue was not long. Both times on arrival I ended up on a bus to get to the terminal but each time the journey was about 3 mins. The bus was waiting when we arrived and wasted no time in leaving when full. I would not consider getting a bus to the terminal to be a negative point. The toilets were clean enough and I didn't have any queue to use them. I didn't have a need to use the food outlets and was not interested in doing any shopping so can't comment about that. So whilst this is certainly not the worlds greatest airport it's far from the worst and in fact for my purposes it was perfectly functional.",7,Arrival and Departure,August 2017,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,3,3,4,0,N/A,N/A,3
Abu Dhabi,✅ Verified Review |  Abu Dhabi airport is not convenient. Lots of walking and long queues due to bad design and narrow spaces. Staff not well-trained.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review | This is a truly dreadful airport and buses from plane to tarmac, chaotic security check just to transit, everywhere is crowded especially night time when many flights leave. Don't even consider using the toilets as they are truly filthy. Use a toilet in one of the business class lounges if you can and we are talking T3. The Air-conditioning is hardly cold due to so many passengers crammed into this place.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review |  I was at Abu Dhabi airport twice (Aug and Sept 2017) going to and from Australia. For a supposedly 1st world airport it is totally inadequate. Queues for all ladies toilets were outside into the corridor. In the departure area UK/OZ there were only two small ladies facilities, one downstairs and one through in another another area. The baby changing room did not have a toilet for toddlers ie young children tired after a 14 hour flight had to be taken to one room then queue endlessly to use a toilet. The adults were so tired we did not notice an i-pad used to pacify a child had been left in the French restaurant upstairs. Nice place, but when we arrived in the UK and contacted them they told us we had to contact Lost Property in the airport. Do not waste your time as the phone will ring for 5 days of random day and night calls and e-mails will go unanswered. After 10 days we spoke to Complaints where the staff member was equally unhelpful. I have been in Guatamela and Tibet airports and they do not pretend to be 1st world.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review |  Had to transit through Abu Dhabi on my way to Sydney from London. I wasn't particularly happy coming off the Etihad flight due to the lack of legroom and the airport didn't help my mood. For a hub airport it felt very small, although in terms of airport land occupancy it dwarves Heathrow. There aren't many shops nor too many places to eat but the biggest problem is the toilets. On my return journey one of the toilet/shower rooms was closed so I had to go and find another. One other I tried was queuing out the door (for a mens toilet this is rare), so I walked for a few more minutes and found another and waited in a shorter queue. However when I left there was a queue out the door. The cleanliness wasn't any good either even though there was a cleaner in them constantly cleaning the floor (why?). But with a wet floor making the room feel like a sauna with a damp smell and the toilet seats just being a mess. Not a pleasant experience. Taxi time in the airport seemed to take too long as well, especially as there didn't seem to be much air traffic. Meanwhile Heathrow the far far busier airport has plenty of shops, more seating areas, more and much cleaner toilets. While a lot of flights are delayed from Heathrow due to only having 2 runways, it puts shame to Abu Dhabi. In future I will try to avoid the airport and fly with another airline to transit elsewhere.",2,Transit,September 2017,Business,Transit,2,2,3,2,2,2,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review | I was transiting at Abu Dhabi on my way from London Heathrow to Jakarta. At first glance, the airport is incredibly busy, however as many passengers flying through Abu Dhabi are also transiting, I had expected the crowd. What does amazes me though, for an airport serving a five star airline and the national airline of the United Arab Emirates was the fact that they could not be bothered to provide enough and adequate toilets for passengers. I had to go through the entire length of the terminal to find a toilet with a short enough line that I would not miss my connecting flight. Even the short line cost me 25 minutes of waiting. The toilet itself was not that clean and definitely not up to the standard neighbouring Dubai has. Shops and seating are available in great numbers but due to the crowd, full. Also, for an airport this size and a five star airline, I did not expect to board my flight to Jakarta through bus transfer in the middle of the day in 45*C weather. It was like being in a sauna. For me, Dubai International is a much better alternative and considering the decline in quality and service of Etihad Airways, I think flying with Emirates via Dubai is the best alternative from here on then. You would be able to find plenty of clean and queue free toilets in Dubai and hop on to your flight through a sophisticated system called a ""gate"".",6,Transit,July 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,2,3,2,2,2,2
Abu Dhabi,✅ Verified Review |  We flew from Istanbul to Melbourne with Etihad (a first for us) and had to endure what must be one of the worst transit experiences in the world - you have to walk for kilometres.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review |  What a terrible airport this really is, overcrowded right from the word go and you have to use shuttle buses from your arrival gate to a transit/arrival drop off area which is cramped with buses queuing just to drop passengers off. As I was transiting signage was awful and confusing, if you have not been here before then you hit security and as is customary in this part of the world they have the minimum security x-ray machines open which in this case was just 2, until one official had the brain wave to open a third as passengers soon ballooned to large queues. Staff were really disinterested and seemed untrained at times, once through after 15 minutes again signage is confusing and then you are met with so much overcrowding its unbelievable! People sitting anywhere they could as there were not enough seats. Toilets are a disgrace so if you can hold until you board the plane then do so. If this is the shining example of this city then its a huge embarrassment to the country and must be avoided at the peak hours of late night and early mornings. Announcements are garbled at best and those trying to speak clearly at the gates can hardly be heard or speak very poorly to be understood. I fear because of the situation in Qatar I have to run the gauntlet of this airport later in the year, something I'm really not looking forward to.",2,Transit,June 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,2,1
Abu Dhabi,✅ Verified Review |  I am absolutely disappointed for the inconvenience myself and other passengers directed to Sydney encountered at the airport. I bought a bottle of water at the duty free shop and I was obliged to drink it all before boarding as it was not allowed. The alternative was to throw it away. I can understand there might be restrictions for specific flights but I see the issue at the duty-free free shop. Why did not they inform me of these restrictions as they scanned my boarding pass? This is the question I asked myself which remains without a valid answer and made my experience at the airport quite bad. I really hope you can do something in order to avoid these issues happen again in the future. Good cooperation among all the services and security operations at the airport is required in order to keep a high quality standards.,2,Transit,April 2017,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,3,4,3,1,3,3
Abu Dhabi,✅ Verified Review |  A very out of date airport where security screening queues for transit passengers are a nightmare. Upon leaving our aircraft we made our way towards the connecting flights signs only to be greeted by long lines of passengers waiting to pass security. It took us no less than 40 minutes to get our bags screened in order to make our way to terminal 3 which was another 10 minute walk. Very disorganised especially at peak times. I hope the new airport will solve these issues.,3,Transit,March 2017,Couple Leisure,Transit,3,N/A,4,0,2,2,2
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review | Amazing arrival experience at Abu Dhabi Airport. It took us only 15-20 minutes from the plane to the taxi. By the E-gate facility we passed through passport control within a couple of minutes.

Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi is an incredibly busy airport to avoid at all cost, famous for the lack of toilets (just Google it). When you manage to find a toilet they are very dirty and have massive queues (10 minutes). Not enough seats at the gates and they are uncomfortable as well. Another lengthy security check also when in transit. Crazy! Again, this airport is my number one to avoid.",1,Transit,December 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,1,1,2,2,2,2,1
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review |  Signs are little confusing. Even for connecting flights you need to go though a security check. However, it only took less than 5 minutes for this on both occasions.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review |  Abu Dhabi are really trying hard to make this old airport function. For transit passengers it can be a little like a warren to navigate - and for short flights the ""barn"" style departure area is a bit past it's capacity.

Abu Dhabi,Horrible management at Abu Dhabi Airport. The US pre-clearance part of the process is painfully slow and badly managed. I would rather complete my immigration in the US where they know what they are doing. Waited in queues for over 2 hrs when there were not too many people around. They were literally opening each luggage before passing it through the scanners which just seems counter productive.,3,Transit,December 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,3,3,1,2,3,1
Abu Dhabi,"My experience of Abu Dhabi airport was not good. Unfortunately we had to spend quite a few hours there. There are very few seats, none of them comfortable. No food outlets to speak of unless you walked to the Sky Plaza. You were not allowed to check in your luggage until 3 hours before travelling, so we had the extra expense of putting it in the left luggage which was expensive. Unfortunately when our gate appeared on the board, the computers went down. Then chaos rained. The queue was more than 10 deep and went for a good distance. We stood for at least an hour, not moving but because there was no-one organising the queue it was chaotic. People were pushing in with loaded trolleys but there was no-one to stop them. It was  the worst experience I have ever had at an airport and hope I never have to use it again.",3,Departure Only,November 2016,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,3,1,2,1,1,N/A,2
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review |  I found Abu Dhabi airport to be one of the best I have ever visited. Restrooms were clean. Food and drink were available, although expensive like at most airports. Seating was never a problem even though I had a layover of several hours. When I had questions, everyone spoke English clearly enough to understand what I was asking and to correctly answer. After leaving my watch at security, one man showed me how to get back to the checkpoint I had used, then explained to someone what I was looking for and the two of them were able to get my watch from the employee who had found it. No one made me feel like nuisance. Announcements and signage were clear. It is confusing for many people that US Customs is there, but I think the airlines should warn travelers. I flew Etihad and was told when I checked in at Kathmandu that US Customs was in Abu Dhabi so I was prepared. After reading other reviews, I was nervous changing planes at Abu Dhabi. But my experience was positive.",10,Arrival and Departure,October 2016,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,4,N/A,5,5

Well, from this experience, it doesn't even come close to being a 3 star at all - heck it's even worse then KLIA to me. Airport is way too crowded, there is not much seat for the transits, not much restaurant, and worse of all, for the first time in my life, I have to queue up for nearly 10 minutes to go into the male toilet, like seriously.

Abu Dhabi,"Poorly organised airport, came in from London and took around a hour to get through security which was a joke as I was told not to worry about my watch, ring or belt and when it beeped I was waved through. Duty free is chaos and the food court is a joke as there is not much choice and they have so many members of staff who just walk to the front and order their usual disregarding the queue. When you get to the gate they seem to chat for a while and give out constant messages but either the microphone is not loud enough or they are speaking too fast they you have to go up and ask them what was said, seats are uncomfortable esp when you have a long transit time.",3,Arrival and Departure,October 2016,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1,1,1,1,1,3,1
Abu Dhabi,"We flew with Etihad for the first time this summer. Excellent flights but the utter shambles of Abu Dhabi airport means we will never fly Etihad again. The airport is grossly overcrowded. Having the misfortune to have to go through the transit area, walking no more than 100 yards to a throughly incompetent inefficient and chaotic ""security scan"" took 1 hour all the while in a dense crowd. Not for the claustrophobic, the frail, mothers carrying children or indeed any human being. Inadequate air con, a lot of shouting by the staff to each other and frankly utterly useless staff. This happened both ways, it completely ruined the journey and we could not wait to get onto the next flight out. Abu Dhabi is the worst airport we have ever been in by a very long way. The scan was hopeless and staff missed two bottles of water my husband forgot were in his hand luggage. Discovered when we unpacked at home.",1,Transit,August 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Abu Dhabi,"Have been in transit in Abu Dhabi twice this summer. The airport seems much too small for the traffic it has. Very long trafficking time and bus service to most planes, even bigger long distance planes. It seemed chaotic and both times our plane was about half an hour delayed due to slow baggage handling. Even so, our luggage was delayed by 1 day both times. Signs are alright, but overall they don't seem to have it under control and I am very surprised to see this airport in the top 40 of 2016.",3,Transit,August 2016,Family Leisure,Transit,3,2,4,0,2,N/A,1
Abu Dhabi,"Insufficient space (airport far too small), only two bathrooms in the international zone, no space for relaxation for long waiting times.

Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi airport is badly designed and involves long, inefficient queues at every step. Haven't spent so long waiting in lines at an airport since LAX in peak hour.

Abu Dhabi,"Not a good experience at Abu Dhabi airport. No air bridge. A shuttle to take passengers to the terminal. Security was ok. Friendly and efficient. But after that, poor food choices, disinterested and rude staff, inadequate seating, unnecessary bureaucratic stamping of boarding passes before scanning them anyway. I got a good price in Ireland to Australia return but I'd pay more for a modern service. Disappointed.",4,Transit,July 2016,Family Leisure,Transit,2,1,3,1,1,2,2
Abu Dhabi,"First time I have travelled through Abu Dhabi. I found the airport lacked space, signage and basic customer service. Also on arrival on both trips we had to catch a bus to the terminal which added time to the transfer. I had lounge access but on entry I was told I could not access the lounge in this terminal and had to walk 15 minutes and a further 5 minutes from my departure gate to have access to an over crowed lounge. The boarding was ok but the PA announcements were in constant.",3,Transit,June 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,1,1,1,2,1,2
Abu Dhabi,Abu Dhabi Airport offers one of the worst travel experiences I have had. Shame they call Etihad the national carrier as the airport has nothing to contribute. From rude and disorganised staff to a food court that was a joke. More than 3 flights landed and the transit security had only 4 scanners running. Hence it taking nearly an hour to get through security. On top of that no air conditioning or fans in the security area. So a miserable start to experiencing Abu Dhabi. The food court was also dismal. Taking over 30 mins to order food at burger king. You had an excellent functioning neighbor in Dubai they should ask for some help.,1,Transit,June 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,2,2,1,2,5,1

Referring to my departure in Abu Dhabi airport on 26 May 2016  I would like to express my appreciation for the service provided.  After putting all my stuff inside the checking point, i forgot my wallet and my mobile in the basket, after two minutes a security lady followed me with my stuff where I was completely shocked as it would be a disaster if i had lost them. I was very impressed.

Abu Dhabi,"You expect to be ripped off a bit when you're at an airport, obviously rental costs for vendors are high, but Abu Dhabi takes this to a whole new level. AUD$7 (USD$5) for a small tub of take-away yogurt is a bit much. Want some chocolates? Be prepared to fork over about $4-$5 for a small bar. Didn't experience the overcrowding at the gate this time, but on our last trip there was about 1 seat per 2 people at the gate. The transfer between gates was no problems on either trip. Duty Free? Forget about it. Just wait until you get home and go to the most expensive retailer you can find for pretty much any product on offer. Lots of work going on, so you'd expect things to be improving, but I can't imagine the prices dropping anytime soon.",3,Transit,June 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,4,3,3,1,1,2,3
Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi is easily the worst international airport I have used. We were in transit at from Amsterdam on our way to Bangkok, and it was a nightmare. Way too crowded, dirty toilets, hardly any seating facilities and to top it all, rude staff. I can't believe that this could even be a hub for a reputed international airline company. I know there's a new airport terminal on it's way, but how does one get over the experience of the old one which includes inefficient staff who will most probably be transferred to the new facility once it is ready? Security screening for transit passengers was long and arduous. Hardly any staff to control the surge. The security staff are rude and inefficient. They hardly care for customer experience. The smoking lounge opens up into the terminal building, and one can hardly tell the difference between the smoking area and the rest with the smell. Avoid this at all cost. Not sure if I would ever want to travel through this airport again.",1,Transit,October 2015,Couple Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Abu Dhabi,"Security and immigration in Abu Dhabi Airport went seamlessly however, the airport is too crowded, decor is tired and food choices sub optimal.

Abu Dhabi,Transit within Terminal 3 (incoming and outgoing flights). Security check queue between flights took half an hour. Many people very frustrated. Even worse was the totally inadequate toilet facilities. I tried two separate male toilets in T3 departure areas before giving up and deciding to wait until later. Men were queuing two deep outside some cubicles. These facilities were strangely lacking for such a busy international airport.,4,Transit,May 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,3,2,3,0,N/A,3,3
Abu Dhabi,"I have travelled through the airport twice in the last month in transit from Manchester to Kathmandu. Going out saw me have to use the older terminal 1 and in fairness, the place coped well and didn't seem too busy. I had no issues with security and the staff were helpful in answering one or two questions that I had. Coming back was a different matter entirely as I had to use terminal 3 late at night and the place was crowded, signage confusing, the toilets were in a sorry state but the best bit was that over a hundred odd people had congregated at Gate 34 in readiness for the Manchester departure only to be told by surly staff that we all had to vacate the lounge in order that passport and boarding passes be checked. There were some unhappy and tired passengers at that moment in time. The powers that be want Abu Dhabi to be a world class airport but it has got some way to go before it becomes one.",6,Transit,April 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,2,2,3,2,2,N/A,1
Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review |  Further to my review posted in March 2016: transitting through Abu Dhabi airport in April on a very long journey from Melbourne to Manchester, I naively thought the airport owners would have read its reviews over the last six months and acted on them. This is not the case. So during a 3-hour layover we experienced the same overcrowding, ignorant staff, overpriced and stale snacks, dirty and dingy washrooms and inadequate seating described by many customers in 2015 and 2016. One apparent manager at my gate suggested I complain via the website. I did this via smartphone on the spot. The website feedback link is well-hidden, goes to an auto-complete form - which then fails to submit. The staff I showed this too really couldn't have cared less. I found the airport's corporate website and used their contact form to submit a complaint. There has been no response to this. Avoid, avoid.",1,Transit,April 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,1,1,2,1,1,2,1
Abu Dhabi,"What a terrible airport this was. I have done my fair bit of travelling and this airport has to rank as one of the worst. Chaotic, lack of signs, unhelpful staff, overpriced, lack of availability at the restaurants and bar available and a lack of seating.

I will avoid this airport in future.",1,Transit,August 2015,Family Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,2,1
Abu Dhabi,"Second time of transit, and just as disappointing as before. Lots of shiney marble doesn't mean its fine to dispense with courtesy. Paid £25GB in local currency for 2x stodgy indifferent sandwiches and small water. Washrooms wet on floors and counters, malodorous and dirty, maybe signage should explain where used toilet paper is correctly deposited as all stalls were overflowing. Many male employees at security checks are ill mannered. Completely pointless second bag search on entering gate seating area. This seemed aimed at preventing bottled water being taken through - why? Airport marketing and strategy appear centred on getting you to pay for premium lounges, with any other customers being herded like cattle. Avoid this airport if viable alternatives appear.",2,Transit,March 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,1,1,1,1,1,3,1
Abu Dhabi,"Although a lot of effort is undertaken to promote the airport as a leading international airport, the facilities of AUH are average and compared with top-notch airports in Asia well below average. Abu Dhabi International Aiport is not only uncharming, but also provides only minimal guest services. Dining options are poor and waiting areas will remind passengers of a hospital or a bus station. Moreover, airport staff are unfriendly and at times rather incompetent. However, there is one positive aspect, wifi coverage is fair througout the airport. In conclusion, try to avoid the airport if you have other travelling options.",2,Departure Only,March 2016,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,2,1,3,1,1,3,1
Abu Dhabi,"A new airport but a complete fiasco. Already saturated and undersized. Corridors too narrow. Long queues at security screening. We landed late from Ho Chi Minh City. Connection to Paris had been removed from screen as gate 34 was officially closed. Etihad staff were only assisting passengers connecting to a few destinations. Others were left with a: ""run to the gate"" which was not on the screen. Staff really need more training in technical and customer service. On both ways, we had to use a Cobus. On our way back, we were leaving from the old terminal. Gate 37. Seating was not suuficient for even one plane. Passengers to Munich who were waiting for gate 38 to open were rudely yelled at by a man to ""move out of the gate and wait in the main terminal"". He didn't tell them that there was no seats available in that terminal. Very cheeky. A very average and stressful experience. I will avoid this airport in future especially that service to/from Paris was average. Meal service takes far too long the way that it has been set by management.",2,Transit,February 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,1,1,0,2,4,2

Most staff are unprofessional, discourteous or maybe just incapable. They still resort to using buses to transport passengers to and from the terminal. Long walk from one terminal to another. Restrooms are terrible, dirty and wet. I was not able to ride with my disabled parents in the seperate transport and had to take all the bags. I had to wait 1 hour at the drop off point for my parents to get there, so that we can carry on to the connecting flight.

Abu Dhabi,"Our family (we are 10 adults, 3 kids and 3 babies) travels together whenever we can. For the first time, we have encountered a bad experience in an airport. Unfortunately, we had to endure 10 hours at this airport. Allow me to point out the good things first. Good things: - the experience in the shuttle bus that drove us from the airplane to the airport was good 'the driver was kind enough to turn on the a/c in the bus despite us being the only ones onboard' - (we were the last ones to disembark the plane). The staff in the food court/village explained patiently what we could get with the meal vouchers issued to us (it wasn't true that you could have any meal as the issuer of the vouchers claimed) - when they changed the boarding gate a few minutes before the scheduled boarding time, we appreciated the person going around the gate to make sure that passengers had transferred to the correct gate. Bad things: - there is no co-ordination between departments - most staff we encountered were apathetic and rude: change of flight counter, person manning the queue in the x-ray area before the boarding gates, ground crew who was wearing a vest with reflective tapes and boarded passengers (that was a first actually because in my years of travelling I have never encountered a ground crew getting our passports and boarding passengers). They were late in boarding passengers because the plane was parked at the wrong gate. Instead of practicing the standard procedure (of asking business class passengers, passengers with kids and seniors to board first), they just ""motioned"" to the passengers to line, they did not even announce it so we were surprised that people far from us got into the line first (when we were already beside the gate).

Poor choice of food and expensive, lot and lots of walking between gates and huge lines for security screening. As usual the flight to Manila was out of an older gate.

Transferring through the airport was an absolute disaster as it seemed the majority of passengers were doing the same thing. With a stroller and a 4 year old in tow, I took the lift down and when the doors opened, the scene was chaotic. People filing into a really small space for what really was a token security check. I was concerned for my children because of the overcrowding. Getting through this process, we then had to go through the duty free shops and try to find somewhere to sit. Shops to buy food and drink were sparse and always busy, again due crowding. Toilets seems to everywhere until you realise they have an entry point at each end and therefore quickly become crowded. There is no prioritisation for first or business class either adding to the lack of service.

Long queue at passport security check at gate. Another hand baggage security check when through passport check but staff were friendly. They still use buses and stairs for boarding. Signage is not too bad, I found my way around and a staff quite helpful. Duty free area is poorly designed. The majority of staff look like their jobs are beneath them and would rather be somewhere else. This airport is doing major damage to the Etihad brand and ruins the above average flight experience I had.

We could find nowhere quiet to eat or rest during a 7 hour stopover - after a flight with Etihad and little to eat or drink I was starving and thirsty but the water fountains were mostly rather dirty and the food outlets very busy, very noisy, very scruffy and very expensive. The airport is being extended and our flight was parked a long bus ride away. The few first class passengers were off loaded and then we all waited about 20 minutes before another bus appeared for business class only. Eventually buses arrived for economy class - it was made worse by the bus having to make two circuits of the airport before it could park at an appropriate entry gate.

Unfriendly staff who could have guided people which is done selectively. Understaffed and unskilled staff. Passport lanes very slow as the check in. The checkin staff - unlike others - at least had a smile unlike the others who were pressurized because of the influx of restless passengers.

If you have not gone through to the boarding gates you can forget doing anything interesting unless you are a millionaire.

It is the only airport I think I have ever seen with long queues for the toilets, some of them snaked around the terminal floor. Security was extremely busy and slow.

Food courts are poor, overcrowded and pretty hard to get a seat to eat any food purchased. I, like many will welcome the opening of the new airport.

After boarding, we spent an hour on the tarmac waiting for ground crews to load bags. On the return leg, we were piled into buses then driven out and parked in front of three different aircraft for 30 min while the driver tried to find the right plane. When we boarded, we again spent an hour waiting while ground crews shuffled bags around. After arriving in Bahrain it turned out that only 7 bags had been loaded for the entire flight.

Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd. And if you're connecting to the US, then you have to repeat this farcical performance. A new terminal is being constructed, and while I suspect it will be posh and modern and beautiful, it will still be burdened by these transit procedures.

Abu Dhabi,"I've lost count the amount of times I've traveled in and out of this airport, but I have been to all 3 terminals to review them here. Terminal 1: This is where all the other airlines (not low cost) flies out to and out from. Small considering its Abu Dhabi, where all the money is at. You are required to scan your luggage prior to check in and 'apparently' only passengers are allowed to go there, even if you're just there to buy flight tickets which is located inside. Only one small coffee shop before the immigration check for you to hang with your loved ones before you say goodbye. Inside the terminal past security, only few stores available, and all are tiny. Terminal 2: This is where the low costs airlines such as Rotana Jet flies in or out from. Terminal is tiny, looks like a ghost town with only one coffee shop that surprisingly has good food. Coming in to the terminal was another nightmare. I've flown in twice here and both times were jam packed. It's as if the queue is never ending. Terminal 3: This is where all the Etihad flights come in and out from. Much better than the other 2 terminals and you can actually check in at the counter with another person accompanying you. Shops inside the terminal passed immigration is better than Terminal 1, although still not as amazing as Dubai Terminal 3 or Doha airport. Still, not recommended for transit more than 3 hours. I had to give mix stars for this airport due to the different service quality that is displayed across different terminals.

No drinks purchased gate side of security are allowed into the sitting area so bottle just bought to drink while waiting goes in bin. No toilets once inside the gate either so onboard in an hour they are going to be popular! Basically if you are departing this gate you are trapped in a security hell. Avoid it at all costs.

It didn't take that long to get through passport control even with a brief spell of getting lost and confused and also a stop off at the toilet - (although I do agree there may not be enough toilets) - Yes there was a queue at immigration but it didn't seem burdensomely long (probably about eight people in front of me). The official was polite and smiled. I was processed relatively quickly as indeed was everyone else. My rucksack came reasonably quickly on the carousel even though I was one of the last people to join the carousel. My vehicle transfer didn't show up. I was left wandering around the terminal building wondering what I was going to do. Eventually I was rescued by a kindly man who made a few enquiries on my behalf and very soon I was picked up and whisked to my hotel.

This information wasn't mentioned anywhere when we looked yesterday. This airport is very small and dull - especially compared to Dubai. Etihad gave us some free meal vouchers at the transport desk which was unexpected. Shame this means McDonalds or the pasta place next door. I ordered spaghetti bolognese but got chicken curry.

If you are using or planning to use Etihad and AUH as your hub please understand: this is not DXB Terminal 3. Not even a poor version of it. It feels like a toy airport. Quite unbelievable how bad it is. Even DMK (the old Bangkok airport) feels more spacious. Hope you will not need to use the toilets. They are disgusting.

Firstly not enough toilets endless queues and wet floor in cubicles sinks in toilets broken no soap in dispensers no hand towels in dispensers. Not enough seating areas poor layout in all areas poor signage not enough refreshment areas for the volume of people. Terminal 1 - far too small for volume of people. We were in terminal 3 again not enough toilets or seating we had to stand outside gate 32 for 3 hours waiting for the gate seating area to be opened with hundreds of other people elderly infirm babies and toddlers all sitting on the floor because of no seats while we could see the gate area through the glass all locked off with hundreds of seats available but we weren't allowed in to use them - this was disgraceful! We were allowed in 10 mins before boarding boarding delayed no explanation finally boarded the plane late take-off delayed for nearly an hour because the fuelling and luggage wasn't complete.

They had to line up for over three hours at customs where they were made to fill out some new form whose English translation was completely ridiculous and impossible to understand. The customs official did not even look at this document when they finally made it to the customs desk!

Abu Dhabi,Worst airport I have been to it is a complete mess. I strongly believe that this airport could not handle such huge amount of travellers. After a long flight transit passengers usually need a quiet place to relax change clothes use the bathroom and charge electronic devices. This airport could provide any of them. Toilets are full and are also dirty. People lie on the floor blocking the passageway while restaurants are all occupied there are no place to sit either. Even if I could sit somewhere power plugs can be hardly found in the gates. Trying to appeal as a luxurious airport while providing such poor facilities is not a good combination believe me.

Abu Dhabi,I am a frequent traveller and I have seen my share of dysfunctional airports but nothing compares to the AUH airport. It did not catch up with its growth over the past few years and passengers have to pay dearly for that shortcoming. It took me 2h from stepping into the building until I reached the gate. There are long queues everywhere check in passport control security and even toilets. Staff are stressed and grouchy. There are at peak hours no seats anywhere in or near the gates.

Abu Dhabi,Transited the airport on the way to Ho Chi Min City ex. Brussels for the 3rd time this year. I'm a very frequent (business) traveller for over 30 years all over the world but Abu Dhabi ranks as one of the worst airports I have had to cross. The infrastructure cannot handle the massive inflow of passengers but the worst is that for some reason they 'forgot' to install a sufficient number of toilets. I have never experienced not even in the most remote airports such a lack of toilet facilities. In the premium lounge there were a 'total' of 4 toilets for men resulting in waiting lines of 10-12 people. Abu Dhabi rates itself very high and thinks it is upper class and grandeur but they are very wrong.

Abu Dhabi,Terrible airport! For a growing carrier like Etihad and the traffic growth all around the gulf Abu Dhabi seems to be lagging behind everyone else. In terminal 3 there are 6 bag drop desks for most of the Etihad fleet (that's over 100 a/c) and around 10 normal check in desks. Average queue time can be anything from 10mins to 1hr plus. Then all the passengers move across to boarder control where of course it is chaos again. Finally when you clear immigration and security you are presented with a terrible selection of shops restaurants and cafes and no seating what so ever (unless of course you don't mind sitting on the floor or the edge of a flower bed). Then when your flight is ready to board there is a single file queue to one maybe two people checking passports. So the queue here for a B777 or A340 is 15mins+. Then you board the a/c and you are away. From the moment you enter the airport to boarding the plane it is a nightmare. I hope the new midfield terminal will be better. I cannot imagine what the A380 with 450-500 passengers is going to look like in terminal 3! I really feel sorry for those passengers. The staff are very rude and not interested in the passenger experience and queuing for security is chaos as staff are shouting almost every world city for passengers to skip the queue for imminent departures so the flow of people in the queue is limited as people skip the queue.

Abu Dhabi,I used AUH on my recent trip to the Philippines as a connection. On both legs I spent only 3 hours in the place. Arrived at Terminal 3 but was departing from Terminal 1 on my outbound leg. The airport website tells you it takes 20 minutes walk but it was more like 10 but I travel light and move fairly quick. Terminal 1 was chaos! It simply is not big enough to house the traffic in and out. Long queues and very little seating. It is also very expensive even for just a drink. Inbound leg both flights arrived and departed from Terminal 3 which is much better. Still the queues into the gates are too long. Had my passport and boarding pass checked twice in the space of 10 meters. All in this place still only gets an average rating.

Abu Dhabi,One of the worst International terminals I have traveled through in the last 5 years. This airport is simply not able to cater to the growing traffic and Etihad's massive expansion. Took almost 2 hours to clear immigration. The staff behavior near the immigration counter is very rude and partial. Just 4 or 5 counters for foreign passport holders (GCC Passport holders have separate counters) and the queues were long.

Compare this with the monstrosity at Charles de Gaulle which seems to have aged in less than 10 years. The biggest problem in landing at the international airport is it take about 15 mins to taxi to/from the runway as the new airport terminal construction means that there are a series of contraflow taxi ways. I read a lot of complaints but I took a family of three young children through the terminal at 2:00am and nothing but praise for the staff and services.

Abu Dhabi,"Picture an airport where the following happens. You arrive and exit from the plane into buses without aircon in the sweltering heat next to an Air Berlin A330. After a while the driver emerges switches the A/C on and drives forever past building sites and runways driving driving at one stage right next to the taxiway so it looks like we'll be clipped by a taxiing B747 driving driving until finally he stops at a rubbish tip. This is next to Gate 19 at an airport building. You enter into Gate 19 and learn that your connecting flight departs from Gate 53. Gate 19 is at a smallish circular building packed with people trying to find their way to other gates. Many need to go one floor up but the single narrow escalator has a 40 m waiting queue. So you take the stairs and follow signs for Gate 53. Walking walking round the corner past renovation sites walking walking oh look there's a narrow walkway but it is clogged with people walking. Gate 53 turns out to be in the ""new"" part of the airport. After a lot of more walking you find gate 53 in time for the boarding call. All passengers of a B777 form a single queue which is attended by a single person checking passport & boarding passes. Many airport staff members walk by merrily but have other tasks than helping out with the check-in procedures. Standing standing shuffling forward ah yes you have cleared the checking person and are guided to a bus. The bus fills up with people doors are closed but we don't move until four more buses are filled up as well only then does our convoy take off. We drive past building sites past the ""new"" part of the airport past a circular building driving come very close to the taxiway. The bus convoy stops four planes down and all passengers from the 5 buses form a single queue to board the plane.

Abu Dhabi,"I was recently flying from BLR to ORD with a connecting flight at AUH. I expected my stopover at AUH to be pleasant. The experience was far from it. First of all directions to gates were not clear especially if you are not aware that your gate might be in a different terminal than your flight actually departs from. In my case my Etihad flight departed from the apron in front of Terminal 3 but my departure gate was Gate 8 in Terminal 1. When I got to Gate 8 (a very long walk from my arrival at the far end of Terminal 3) it was closed with nobody manning it and without any sort of notice. It turned out that the security screening for several gates was being channelled through a single line entering through a different gate although nobody was being told about it. The security screening process was slow. Once past the security process I had 2 hours to my connecting flight. Sadly there were no restaurants coffee shops or even snack counters in the departure area which had far less seating than one would expect for 777 flights. Even more sadly there wasn't a single water fountain or even a soda vending machine to quench one's thirst. For about 8 departure gates (all shuttle gates not aerobridges) there was only one toilet for females and one for males potentially having to serve a couple thousand waiting passengers. I noticed that the area had been updated with a big-screen TV lounge area and LED lighting but somehow the thought of providing adequate toilet and refreshment facilities doesn't seem to have occurred to the authorities. I didn't experience the other parts of the airport which are supposed to be quite impressive but nonetheless there is no reason such a sub-par section should exist in the international airport of such a wealthy country especially when it is part of the terminal dedicated to the flagship carrier of Abu Dhabi. One final word about Etihad. I flew economy class (""Coral"") and I did not find their service to be significantly better than say British Airways or Lufthansa.

Abu Dhabi,Just returned from holiday which involved transiting at AUH. The boarding process at Terminal 3 is to say the least chaotic. Especially if your flight involves being bussed from the terminal to where your plane is parked and because of this (notwithstanding the tight connection times between a lot of Etihad flights) they never seem to leave on time. Facilities do leave a lot to be desired. With planned construction of a new terminal building you hope that issues such as being bussed to and from terminals (abnormal in today's era of international airports) and chaotic boarding are ironed out. I'm not that optimistic though.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,It seems that this airport can't handle the rapid growth of Etihad Airways. Terminal is overcrowded most of the time. Very stressful airport to transfer from one flight to another.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Absolutely ghastly airport - the worst I have visited bar none. None of my flights left on time with a minimum of 90 minutes delay - so other connections were missed. What is the point of having an exclusive Etihad Terminal 3 if you are always dropped off at Terminal 1 - especially since there is no information that you're actually in another Terminal. That's after a convoluted bus ride of at least 20 minutes. So many flights taking off mine - due to take off in 80 minutes - couldn't fit on the board so we were left to wander like the undead looking for information. The security queues were horrendous all 4 times with no organisation and plenty of attitude from ground staff. Took 2 hours to clear that on separate transfers. No obvious sign as business class that there was a separate queue for us and first though you wouldn't have been able to get through the throng of people lining up almost to Terminal 1. The lounge was heaving and unimpressive. The only thing I liked in Terminal 3 was the air- con that others dislike as by that point I was extremely hot from the stuffy overcrowded tunnel. It's not as though the Etihad hard product or customer service in the air is very good either so I will never willingly go through Abu Dhabi again. Avoid!,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I really did not like my stopovers going and coming back from Bangkok to Brussels. I do not understand why passengers on international flights must take a bus to go the terminal building (T1) or to go to the airplane from the new terminal 3. Toilets were difficult to find and not very clean. There is a lack of seats at the boarding gate and staff is not friendly. Avoid this airport if you want a relaxing transfer to your connecting flight.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,This is a very good airport with good services. Everything is good from gate to gate. There is one thing and that is the security checks between terminal 1 and 3 that can cost a lot of time.

Abu Dhabi,Terrible place considering the vast construction going on you would think it would be in order to provide a few seats for passengers to sit on. Information wise one hand does not seem to know what the other is doing. Gates change frequently and you need to be vigilant or you could easily miss a flight. T1 seating completely inadequate. Flight info boards not very prominent in such a crowded lounge and hard as it is to believe of the five international clocks the Abu Dhabi one was stopped. Gate 5 at T1 for Manila bound passengers is disgraceful. You have to sit on the floor then when the scanning starts everyone is herded into a small lounge which has space for about 80 people with half that amount of seating. Not very comfortable for the compliment of a 777.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A

Abu Dhabi,"One of the worst airports I have ever had the misfortune to visit. It is simply chaotic a shambles. Staff running around with pieces of scruffy paper which apparently give aircraft arrival and departure times as the electronic boards were just plain wrong. Example 4th April Manchester flight signed as gate 51 - when you arrived there a man with a scruffy piece of paper said ""No now gate 29"". The food facilities and seating were of a very poor standard - it really is a third rate airport and that is being generous. Because of this I shall never fly Etihad again except I do have a return in July unfortunately.",N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Clear signage - was transferring from T1 to T3. Long walk but easy to find way and not too crowded. Security lines short and simple. Most of T3 seems to be focused on shopping. waiting area once at the gate spacious but no toilet facilities one you have entered these areas and had passport and ticket checked so do that before you get to gate. Seating area outside of gates limited. Facilities seemed clean and bright. Ground staff can be surly and not very competent and boarding procedures rather chaotic - no plan to board plane - just a dash to the plane!,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Abu Dhabi terminal 3 departure area is no bigger than a small shopping centre and does not have sufficient seating or toilet facilities for the hundreds of passengers who pass through and in the case of a recent flight which was delayed 36 hours it proved to be totally inadequate. We had a limited choice of food with only half of the vendors accepting the boarding passes for compensatory meals. Queues built up to almost half an hour waiting for some people many of whom had children. Anyone has had the misfortune to visit Abu Dhabi international terminal 1 they would know that it is a small cramped dirty and very unorganised place. There are insufficient chairs and dozens of passengers were sitting around the floor in corridors and food spillage was evident everywhere even after I motioned to a cleaner. Toilets are unclean and insufficient for the number of passengers. Abu Dhabi airport does look very impressive from the outside the duty free/shopping area looks smart and there is a good deal of high tech equipment but that's where it ends: it is small and cramped the staff are either incompetent or more likely badly trained by Etihad Airways communication with passengers is abysmal - PA announcements are limited and the display boards are very inaccurate. The Abu Dhabi Airport website is inaccurate and not kept up to date. Catering facilities would make a small village shopping centre look impressive - and they do not cater for either the volume of passengers or offer them much by way of choices; the idea of queuing in order to get into a departure gate lounge is pathetic at the least and our case they made passengers queue for over an hour just to get to this point. Overall rating - pathetic.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Transited twice recently through this Airport and on the first occasion it was a nightmare. I had been through once before luckily because you land at the old Terminal 1 something nobody tells you and have to find the small signs directing you to Terminal 3. It's not easy to find through the various food outlets etc. You enter what seems like the entrance to a very large Tube Station and following the signs for about twenty minutes however we had to queue for about 90 minutes to get through security for entrance to the gates in T3. A complete nightmare with large groups of travellers milling around and making no progress whatsoever. The security gates in chaos with the personnel shouting pushing getting passengers to take off belts shoes etc. If your lucky enough to survive this you enter the shopping area. Small compared with Dubai. There are not enough seats and gates often have wrong information at the entrance plus be aware that the gates from 28/32 means that you will have a transit to your aircraft by bus. No enough seats toilets difficult to find and departure boards showing wrong gates. In short a total mess I wont ever be flying Etihad or transiting through AD again.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,This is really 2 airports connected by a long walk. The new terminal (3) is fairly modern but very bad and the old terminal (1) is awful. In T1 you have to queue past individualized security checkpoints into overcrowded waiting area pods. Sometimes several planes are leaving from the same pod and it can be incredibly chaotic. There is nowhere near enough seating. The food and shopping are ok for a small domestic airport bu not for an international hub. Judging by its looks Terminal 3 should be very nice but it has a lot of problems. You have to walk through duty free to get to gates and it is a congested maze. It is a 10-15 minute walk from the security point to the gates where the Etihad planes depart and they announce boarding long before boarding actually starts. Because of extra security there is not enough seating in the gate area for all the passengers so if you answer the boarding call you can find yourself sitting for 30-40 minutes waiting in an outer lounge for the gate lounge to empty so that you can get through security and onto the plane. If you're flying business class forget getting on early unless you like to push people over. Etihad staff work extremely hard to make the situation tolerable and AUH staff are very considerate and helpful. It seems that the design and management of this place make this a most undesirable place to transfer. Etihad's lounges are fair at best but way undersized for the traffic. Sometimes I have had to push my way in to get a chair. On the plus side Immigration Customs and Security staff have always been pleasant.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I've been through both Abu Dhabi and Dubai a few times. Etihad and Emirates as airlines provide nice services but I'd avoid Abu Dhabi airport if I had the choice. The airport is obviously striving for an upmarket feel but it's quite cramped the organisation and staff are somewhat lacking there's few opportunities for rest fresh air or natural light. The variety of food and facilities on offer is pretty limited too.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,This is a new airport and its got to be the worst airport I have used it took almost 2 hours to get from our arrival gate to our new departure gate. The staff have no interest in helping you. How this airport works I have no idea its total chaos there is no organisation here. I will use Dubai or Doha in future.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Never flying Etihad again. Chaotic no information on the boards long queues for security with unfriendly staff shouting misleading instructions. Also on arrival I had to step over passengers sitting on the flight bridge (presumably they were waiting for the plane I arrived on?). It was the same on the return trip at a different time of day (01.00) so not attributable to a busy period.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Had to go through security once more during transfer and the lines were ridiculously long. The airport is constantly crowded in the mornings and narrow hallways make it a lot worse. Toilet facilities could be a lot cleaner. Also I had to walk to the other end of the terminal to board my connecting flight because I disembarked via shuttle bus. Overall the airport feels somewhat inadequate to support the influx of travellers. If you are deeply concerned with time I would not suggest this airport as my flight was delayed by an hour because some passengers can't find their way to the gate.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,We had to queue for 90 mins to transfer flights make sure you have at least 3 hours between flights. It is the second time I have used this airport the first time I took it as a one off but both times have been a nightmare. I am glad my returns were not through Abu Dhabi. I think it will be Qatar in future.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Avoid this airport at all costs. We were transiting through it and still had to go through security checks. The queue was approx 200m long and it took us around 2 hours to get through.

Abu Dhabi,I have been trough Abu Dhabi a few times. It is getting worse. Unfriendly people very long walk ways most Etihad flights don't use an aerobridge bus transfer.

Abu Dhabi,It is like a Shopping mall. The free wifi was welcome but was slow. The walk from my arrival gate to my departure gate was unending. Tiring. You really feel like lying down for sometime. The lack of food options near the gates is funny. Expensive food and Duty Free are a put off. Wonder why you go through a security check again when you are just transiting. Staff are usually unfriendly maybe it's a culture thing. Make money out of tired and miserable people is possibly the goal here. The flight to Mumbai was from a gate which did not have an aerobridge. Bus service from the Gate to the airplane reminded me of 1990s. The bus ride was a good 10minutes. Not impressed.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Avoid this Airport. I was in transit at this Airport twice. Once heading to Paris from KLIA and then on the return flight back to KLIA. Both transits were a major disappointment. Long walk from one terminal to the other. Poor signage. Only arrows pointing the gate numbers. Rude airport staff. Got yelled upon in Terminal 1 by Airport staff who told us to move on and not to group together in one area. Low ceiling which give you that choking feeling. Very hard airport seats very uncomfortable. Dirty toilets. Expensive food with limited number of food outlets. Limited number of duty free shop which are expensive with rude shop keepers. Airport staffs are not helping or clueless about their work. My flight got delayed for almost an hour on the Tarmac even though doors are closed and all passengers onboard.

Abu Dhabi,It was my second time transferring flights at this airport. Sheer disappointment again after 2 years. Huge rush long queues and it seemed that nobody is taking care of passengers. I don't know why they don't have multiple gates or terminals to handle such situation. Also there are no sittings arrangements for the elderly or pregnant women. Etihad staff at airport were also not efficient. I suggest to avoid this airport and use Doha or Dubai as transferring city.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Came here for a conference on a Qatar airways flight. The staff were rude lots of confusion as to who goes where especially since I had a hotel visa which I needed to get as a hard copy.

Abu Dhabi,"Transited in Abu Dhabi twice in August and September 2013. It's one of the cleanest with helpful staff. It is indeed chilly but other than that it's easy to get around and you really do have everything you need there even if you are ""trapped"" inside for more than 10 hours like I was.

Abu Dhabi,I have been using this airport for many years. Terminal 1 (old) used by most airlines is overloaded with poor services and only one poorly attended bathroom. Terminal 3 used exclusively by Etihad is a bit larger but again operating beyond its design capacity; with only three bathrooms and cheap cleaning contractor cleanliness is an issue mainly if you want to use the cabinets. Abu Dhabi is trying to imitate Dubai's success but apparently without success. Amongst the three major hubs in the area Dubai Doha (till the opening of new airport end of this year) and Abu Dhabi Dubai remains the best. If you have a choice then avoid this airport.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I transited through Abu Dhabi (onward and return) on the Chicago-Abu Dhabi-Mumbai route last month. The airport seemed to be too confusing and crowded with no proper signboards guiding you to the different terminals. All you see is gate numbers and you have to somehow know which terminal contains which gate numbers. Queues are pretty long and no airport official to guide/manage these queues. If you are travelling with infants remember that AUH doesn't have any sort of priority for such passengers. So you'll have to wait in the queues for hours. Airport staff especially at the ticket/transfer desks are unprofessional rude and have an indifferent attitude. I had booked a bassinet seat for my 10-month old baby but was told at Mumbai airport to try for the seat at AUH since most of the seats were taken. On checking at the transfer desk in Terminal 3 the guy at the counter lied and said that I already have bassinet seats only to realize otherwise when I boarded the Abu Dhabi-Chicago flight (15 hrs journey). Seats at departure gates are very few narrow and not comfortable. Overall not a world class airport as it is projected to be. Its really disappointing and should be avoided if you are travelling with infants/kids.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I recently travelled to Europe through Abu Dhabi and to be honest I was less than impressed. My main concern would be that the terminal lacks staff and desks to process the amount of guests coming though at any one time. (Inbound and Out). On our return journey the customs software went down (Aug 2013) which happens but the time to get the system back up and operating was extremely slow (2 hrs). With major events like the Grand Prix coming up I really hope they ramp things up to accommodate for the crowds expected. Just small things like customs staff wearing iPhone headsets under their head dress and they have absolutely no interest in being welcoming at all. Then the Taxi system waiting outside was totally out of control there were no lines or order to the process the waiting passengers it was every man for himself with Taxi's at one stage 3 deep across the road with people walking around moving cars.

Abu Dhabi,I am sitting in Abu Dhabi airport and can't believe I am in same place as other reviewers. I agree it is a bit chilly but not uncomfortably spans it is 02.00.

Abu Dhabi,"Avoid this airport. Toilets are digesting not enough toilets rude immigration staff who are lazy and slow - would seem that they take delight in seeing how long they can take to process people. We waited for 3 hours at 2.00am to be processed while ""security"" were escorting others to the front of the huge lines - so lines were not moving at all! The signage boards and sequencing of services does not exist or work. Food options are limited expensive and disappointing. Same goes for shopping. This airport does not cut it amongst the international airports and we have travelled in many. We are regular travels into and out of Abu Dhabi and at least 90 percent of our flights leave at least an hour late. It is normal practice for us to sit on a plane for over an hour prior to it taking off. It is also normal practice for Etihad to wait for late guests who just dawdle in. It is also normal for passengers to try and swap seats like their choosing from an a-la-carte menu - we have been asked to swap seats with these passengers by the flight attendants even though we have taken the trouble to check-in early and secure our preferred seats.

Abu Dhabi,I found this airport quite unpleasant. This is my second stopover here and I've found the staff unhelpful and uninformative. Our flight has now been delayed by 50 minutes without explanation the toilets are gross and the air con doesn't work in there and they took my water when I went into the waiting area for my flight despite my having just bought it 5 minutes earlier on my way from the previous flight.

Abu Dhabi,I've been through AUH several times in recent years it's always been at night and it's always very busy. This time I had a tight daytime connection (1hr 20 mins) and the inbound flight was 1hr late. Not a problem - the airport was extremely quiet at 9am no queues at all in Security and Etihad held the connecting flight until all the transit passengers had boarded.

Abu Dhabi,The airport was clean with average facilities but the reason for the low score is the queue time at immigration. I got off my flight at 2am having flown business class into Abu Dhabi. There were 30 immigration counters open each with at least 60 people queuing. The process was so slow with staff leisurely processing customers at a rate of 3 minutes per person that it took 3 hours to get through. There were people complaining all around and the people stamping the passports seemed to be operating 'in their own time' which was extremely slow interspersed with conversation and joke breaks between counters.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A

It took me 50 minutes to get visa as only 4 immigration booths were open. Also there are not many people who speak English to guide/direct travellers. Signs are clearly marked but information on monitors is not always correct. For example my flight was at 1.45am and around 12am monitors started showing ""Last Call"". My flight got delayed to 2.45am. Though monitors at airport showed flight delayed but at 1.45am started showing that flight was closed.

Abu Dhabi,I travelled with Etihad from Melbourne to London. I don't know what terminal I was in but I wasn't that impressed. It was quite small and confusing. Lots of staff telling people where to go and you could quite easily go the wrong way and miss your connection.

Abu Dhabi,A transfer airport to avoid. I travelled from Turkey to Australia with a stop-over in Abu Dhabi and it was not a pleasant experience. Apparently 1.5 hrs hour is not enough to catch your flight - unless it's delayed which mine (luckily) were. It took about 25-30 minutes to get out of the plane onto a bus and drive to the airport. Then you had to walk to the transfer gates and stand in line for another 30-40 minutes for another security check meaning you are left running for your gate because boarding closes 20 minutes prior to take-off. You do not get to skip line because boarding for your flight had already started - quite frankly they make a huge deal out of stressing the difference between economy and first class passengers - only the latter are treated nicely. The information boards are not updated so only once I had arrived at the gate was I told that the plane would be delayed. At that point you're stuck in a gate with no access to any facilities. On the plus side there is free wifi but that's about it. I have no idea what any of the facilities in the airport was like.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,We just got off the plane from Brussels. Everything looks new however services and information are below par! One expects some kind of way to see which gate your connecting flight is at.

Abu Dhabi,Abu Dhabi Airport isn't the most appealing of the world's airports but does have some virtues. The duty free stores are well stocked and the upper level food hall adequate enough. However (and this has been pointed out in previous reviews ad nauseum) the air-conditioning is just far to cold for normal passenger comfort. Virtually everyone had blankets over them while waiting for flights!

Abu Dhabi,A very unpleasant airport. I connected from London to Bangkok thinking it would be a nice experience to travel via a Gulf airport as so many people are doing the same. Never again. It was bad enough dealing with ghastly food on Etihad. The food options at Terminal 3 are limited and very expensive. Also the fast food on display looked as though it was there 48 hours before. Not very pleasant at around 20 dollars for a similar meal which In London would cost less than half. A small bottle of water cost around 6 US dollars. Not many places to sit but lots of shops.

Abu Dhabi,Been a couple of years since I last travelled through AUH and nothing much has changed - completely useless flight information screens poor choice of duty-free goods and eating options and absolutely brutal air conditioning. On the plus side the airport is built on a human scale and is easy to transit through there's plenty seating and access to clean toilets (things that Dubai fails badly on).

Abu Dhabi,Three and a half hour transit for CAI-AUH-MEL in terminal 3 only. Coldest airport ever! AC is set so high we had to get our jumpers out. Very spacious clean and lots of seats. Kid's play area is ok but mostly for under 6's and just a few cars and a play house. Free wi-fi and computer terminals. Not much to do for that length of wait - as a transit point it needs more activities. Also even though departure gate was directly next to arrival gate we had to walk to the other end of the terminal to the arrivals area clear security and then walk back again to the departure gate.,5,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Transfer from MAN to BKK. As a Silver member of an Etihad guest I can access the Al Reem lounge which is a big plus apart from duty free not a lot of things to do apart from free wifi. However as previous travellers note at peak times the security clearance for transit passengers can be very poor - I saw the longest line yet all the way back to T1 nearly on the way out but no queue at all for the return flight. Like a lot of other airports need to plan better for peak periods early morning early evening - if they do this it would get a lot better reviews.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"One of the worst airport I have ever crossed so far. We landed at Gate 34 to catch a connecting flight at Gate 17. After walking 20 minutes I came across a big banner ""Gate 17"" and there is no gate underneath! After catching somebody with airport badge came to know that its closed and have to go through Gate 1415 and 16 to go to Gate 17! Once inside there is no water no toilets and highly inadequate seats for 5 gates in that area! No electronic board showing which flight on which gate anything. If you need water go back to the main mall area and then again come back via security checks! Even worse for the families. First time I came across a situation where families are told to seat while they send across single and passengers without kids to the aircraft and 5 minutes into the bus boarding activity airport officials realized there are no additional bus and they sent the families in the same congested bus!! As far as possible I will not travel again via Abu Dhabi. One mistake is enough.",1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,The airport has come a long way but travel through AUH is still a rude awakening for many people. There needs to be better management and more thought put into the finer details. My biggest complaint is about the process (time delays) for eye scanning that passengers are put through. Management needs to realize that when there is a line with 100 arrival passengers but only one employee working this is extremely inefficient and irresponsible. There is no one monitoring this section of the airport so you'll have people who are impatient pushing and going through to the front of the line. In this section of the airport there is no seating for passengers after a long flight. People are left waiting for hours just waiting with no fans or air conditioning! After speaking to many people who have also flown through AUH and DXB they have said the experience left a negative outlook regarding travel to UAE.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Very unimpressed! My husband and I arrived in Abu Dhabi after a 14 hr flight from Australia. The airport is chaotic staff are fairly brusque and not helpful and there is nowhere to get a shower. In addition the Al Reem lounge was advertised as being accessible to certain MasterCard holders. The fine print as we were told at said lounge's check-in counter is that this is only for cards issued from Africa and the Middle East. Alternative option is the airport hotel which only rents rooms for the day. The place gives the impression of giving the ups to ordinary mortals like myself who travel economy. When compared to other airports like Singapore Seoul Hong Kong Tokyo Osaka Bangkok this place leaves a huge amount to be desired. Won't be flying Etihad again if I can avoid it.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,MAN-AUH-DAC. Arrived at T1 Gate 7 and my onward flight was on the same aircraft at the same gate some 90 minutes later. You can't beat that for convenience. T1 is clearly more cramped than T3 which I have used before and I found the ATMs hard to locate without directions from staff. Ironically before opening up the scanners at Gate 7 the security team there used the passenger waiting area as location for their smoking break - in direct view of the no-smoking notices. Makes you wonder about their professionalism.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Terminal 1 has now been refurbished and has a fresh and spacious feel to it. The new First/Business Class lounge is excellent for food quality beverages cleanliness showers etc. For a long stop over pay the lounge price for a good meal and relaxing time. Immigration takes no more than 5 minutes. Taxi's plentiful outside.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,My first transit at AUH from DAC to MAN. Arrived at T3 with about 70 minutes between flights. As my departing flight also left from T3 the walking distance involved was refreshingly short. No queues at security. Only back-up was at document checkpoint at the gate. If you don't want to be forced to go through the duty free shop simply use the toilets after security as they have a second exit that leads to the gate concourse. My connecting flight left from a remote stand necessitating a relatively short bus transfer. All together a smooth and comfortable transit experience.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Through AUH to BAH. Arrived at a remote stand and bussed to Terminal. Clear signage made it easy to navigate along with plenty of Departure screens. As previously stated quite busy so seating can be a bit hit and miss but they can be found. However after 7 hours in the air a walk about was most welcome. Boarding through Gate 18 was bizarre a doorway that actually led to Gate 17 and 18. Even weirder was that two flights were through this door at the same time which led to confusion for passengers. Security was a drag with two flights passing through one metal detector and two x-ray machines. They got it sorted and we were bussed to another remote stand. Return was at night. Arrived at another remote stand and again a bus to the Terminal. I was travelling with an infant access to a stroller would have been advantageous at the gate. Upon arriving at Flight Transfer we found a fleet of strollers. Why position them here? A reasonably long walk down to Gate 34 (10 mins) with plenty of seating at the Gate in a clean and airy environment. Overall not a bad experience. Terminal 1 is rather dated but great for people watching and shopping. Terminal 3 is modern and bright but can involve a fair trek down to the Gates in the 30's. Be prepared is my advice. Roll with it as it can be busy and perhaps not follow the norm expected of some western airports.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Very bad experience with this airport definitely will never travel again through it. Very bad attitude from immigration staff. E-gates rarely working and no one there to help.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,AUH even though it has a 'new terminal' is seriously deficient in the security area where queues can stretch back along the moving walkways/escalators. Their Etihad airport lounge is cramped and uncomfortable and the free internet stations in the terminal usually on 60% operational.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,A bit unsure given the previous views here. But very pleased. Excellent signage super staff easy transfer good food and duty free. Seating is limited but sufficient. Announcements clear and sufficient. Boarding easy and painless. Much better than I had expected and would be happy to recommend the airport for anyone transferring. I used terminal 3 only - I cannot review terminal 1.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Transited through Abu Dhabi to and from Europe on a recent trip. Terminal Three is very modern and clean but badly laid out and crowded. Security was quick but the duty free area was very small. It states on the airport website that there are showers. When I arrived I found that the showers were the equivalent to the ones in changing rooms. How are passengers supposed to know to bring their own towel/soap etc. The customer service is very inefficient. I was redirected several times when asking for the gate for my flight to Larnaca.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,MAN-AUH-MEL return. Passed through T3 on the outward leg but had to switch from T3 to T1 on the return. Both Terminals were clean and bright with good facilities. Seating is at a premium but was to be found. The only frustration was that we arrived and left from adjacent gates in T3 on our outward leg but had to walk miles at the upper level to go through security to descend to the lower departure level. The only reason for this that I could see was to ensure that you went through the duty-free shopping area. The return arrangements meant we had to switch from T3 to T1 but staff were on hand to direct you and it was all quite painless. My first experience of UAE and I would not hesitate to use the airport again.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I found the signage between Terminal 1 and 3 to be very poor with no indication of which terminal certain flights depart from. Not enough toilets in T3 is another issue however free internet was a bonus though.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Appalling experience in Terminal 1. There was no restaurants operating. The only food/drink outlet Starbucks was overwhelmed and ran out of most food items. Seating inadequate.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Hot muggy 34 degrees at 2am in the morning and no Air conditioning. We felt like we were in a sauna. Plus I don't understand why we need to go through about 3 separate security points when on a connecting flight. 1 is fine but 3? We haven't left the airport we just got off the plane and we are going on a connecting flight and we were already screened at Heathrow which has very strict security protocols. The wifi is slower than dial up Internet. Terminal 1 is weird the whole place from floor to ceiling is tiled like a bathhouse no windows. Terminal 3 is better because it is modern with floor to ceiling glass so it feels open. I don't know what Abu Dhabi will do to improve their staff because they aren't friendly helpful.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Was impressed with the staff at T3 I have always found that a smile helps. I was treated with courtesy at all times - even passport control officer wished me a pleasant stay. Upon departure there was a long queue for economy check in and I was asked if I would like to check in on the First Class desk to save me waiting.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,The airport is small overcrowded and needs improvement. The seating is limited. At some gates if you clear the security then you cannot use the restrooms! The air conditioning was barely adequate for the heat and the crowds. The signage is poor. The signs are parallel to the gates but one walks perpendicular to those signs. The staff were a bit gruff and impatient.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Passed through a couple of times - T1 to T3 connection and another connection within T3. 2 hour connections both ways so no problems. T1 is a crowded dump. Signage is poor in both terminals and T3 is a 10-minute walk. Transit Security seemed pretty disorganised but only took a few minutes. T3 had plenty Duty Free Shops with prices similar to DXB. Eating options were adequate and no problems finding toilets. Air conditioning was a bit brutal and there appeared to be plenty of cold people in the middle of the night. Biggest criticism for me were the dreadful flight information screens which are tiny and only covered departures up to 45 minutes ahead - you didn't know which gate to go to and the single information desk wasn't even manned. On balance I think I prefer AUH to DXB for a 2 hour transit - at least AUH is built on a human scale.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"I have used this airport on a number of occssions but until recently did not see how bad it is. I usually go from the plane to the transit hotel to the lounge and then to the plane. But this time I was unfortunately travelling economy and experience the nightmare of Abu Dhabi - it is just a bad airport with staff not really knowing what they are doing saying ""yes you can find a trolley around the corner"" I nearly walked to London and did not find one. The transfer between terminals is a nightmare with no rationale between what you should do - and with the upgrading in Terminal One the problem is worse. And don't get me started on the rude staff who are the transit hotel. Avoid this airport for your sanity alone.",2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"On arrival at Abu Dhabi airport from Heathrow we were shocked to see a small area of poor quality overcrowded seating and just a shabby very expensive cafe. Other than this there were some duty free shops. There was a general shortage of toilet facilities. All very depressing when you know you will be spending 6 hours there on your return journey. Etihad might have nice lounges for business and first class passengers but these facilities are not available to economy class passengers. The security check point for transfer passengers was heaving with queues of people and we found it very confusing. When I reached the front of the queue they sent me away because I was missing a tag? On our return journey we paid to use the ""Hotel Lounge"" which was worth every penny.",2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,T3 is bright clean with speedy security and passport controls. The transit zone before/between flights is not a place to spend more than 2 hours (limited choice of food and shops) but not a bad experience either. T1 is in an another league: old and worn okay for arriving at but not a nice place to depart from. All in all a basic but efficient airport as long as you pass through T3.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Transfer at AUH from LHR enroute to CMB and on return journey. Arrival at AUH Terminal 3 - this is the first time in many years I'd passed through Abu Dhabi and T3 was new to me. Fairly typical modern airport terminal - clean spacious lots of steel and glass. 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 for connecting flight - while still architecturally eye catching showing its age and feeling a bit sticky. 10 or so free internet terminals several of which weren't working. On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg). Once through security the route inevitably winds it's way through a huge shopping area before reaching the T3 departure gates. As is the case with T1 there were several free internet terminals. Plentiful seating at the gates themselves.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"Terminal 1 is horrendous in every way and spending any more than 1 hour there is excruciating. A few days ago I had a 5-hour layover in Abu Dhabi airport not knowing which terminal the departure would be from upon landing. Knowing what terminal 1 was like I feared the worst. Thankfully it was from the new T3 which is a huge improvement. I must say the ""most improved airport"" award that AUH has gotten is really deserved. T3 has plenty of shops plenty of places to eat (which is severely lacking in T1) and plenty of computers with free internet (there were never any lines). It is also clean and looks very modern with actual windows unlike the old terminal. Staff were also quite friendly. When looking at the departure board a staff member immediately approached me and asked me where I was travelling and directed me towards the appropriate gate. I wont mind transiting through this airport for future journeys as long as it is through T3.",4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,The new Terminal 3 is a huge improvement on Terminal 1 with upgraded facilities and overall good passenger experience. Not much to complain about other than the limited seating provided for passengers at T1 and then some rude abrupt and unfriendly police at security checkpoints who has the ability to make any traveller feel most unwelcome for using this airport for travelling purposes.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,After a 14+ hour flight I was looking forward to getting a hot shower and a relaxing nap in the airport hotel or at least in one of the pay-for-service lounges during my 8 hour layover. We landed in the new terminal (3?) and whilst at first glance its nice clean and new looking I soon discovered there were very few directional signs no shower facilities no airport hotel or lounge facilities (unless you're Etihad silver or gold member) hardly anywhere to sit nothing to do at all except buy duty free items or line up for 30 minutes of free internet and finding an open information desk was a huge achievement. I was eventually told I would have to go back though security and walk over to the old terminal if I wanted a shower but after having dealt with the rude security staff I declined. Its a real pity that the new terminal is so poorly outfitted will make me seriously reconsider flying Etihad if I have a long layover again.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I am surprised at how a major airport hub like AUH could run with no facilities whatsoever apart from the free internet. I had a very long 12 hour transit in AUH en-route to Cairo from Sydney and was ashamed at the service of facilities. I admit the new terminal 3 is a big push into the skies from the old terminal 1 but there's still more pushing up to do if they want passengers to enjoy their transit in AUH. I have also departed and arrived in AUH and would give them a thumbs up at the services offered during departure and arrival but check in is a nightmare with all Etihad flights checking in from the same line of desks.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Part of an airport's ranking and reviews should depend on how they deal with a medical emergency. I was flying from AUH 2 weeks ago and a passenger in his late 50's dropped to the floor in the duty free. It took almost 15 minutes for a doctor to arrive at which point the passenger had died. A person approached the airport manager about this delay and was told if he did not mind his business he would be detained by the police. Abu Dhabi airport is tiny compared to other major airports where medical staff reach the scene within 3 minutes.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Etihad staff nice but the equipment is dysfunctional. Then there's all the back and forth between the new terminal that is fairly nice and the old terminal which is a dump with a glittery paint job. There are some pluses though: a special business/first class check-in in a separate space and a dedicated immigration officer that covers all airlines. One staffer there was kind enough to go track down a lost sketchbook for me after I had already gone through immigration. The business lounge for BA and other airlines was too small for the number of flights served at peak.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,In transit only although a change of terminals was required in both directions. Terminal 1 is the old terminal which is short on seating although architecturally interesting with the tiled mushroom in the centre. However seating is limited food choice is limited and the place is kept over-airconditioned. Terminal 3 is the new terminal and is more spacious with better facilities and a greater choice of eating places: if you are in transit it may be better to stay in Terminal 3 until an hour before your flight and then head across to Terminal 1. Security for transfer passengers changing terminals is reasonable with plenty of space and barriers to direct passengers. I was quite impressed.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Transited AUH both ways. Modern airport with what seems like miles to walk from arrival gate to security and back to departure gate. Long queue for transit security. Usual duty free shops but not very cheap. Free wi-fi signal very weak in food court area. Smell of tobacco smoke everywhere despite the airport being non-smoking in public areas the sliding doors to the smoking booths do not close fully allowing the smoke and smell to permeate through into the rest of the airport.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,"Arrived from LHR on BA at 8pm. Slightly amused by the ""greeter"" in local arab dress at the gate welcoming deplaning passengers. Didn't have the personality for it I suppose. Walked through aquarium-like central area (lime green and blue tiles) and off to surly immigration. All our information was manually entered into a computer painfully slowly (key-by-key) and then collected baggage. Was a pretty quick once past immigration though crowded. Airport also appeared to have the lingering smell of cigarette smoke. Airport seemed very crowded and is probably going to be expanded at some point. Car to city was as expected. Airport was not what you'd expect from an oil-rich city-state.",3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Flying through Abu Dhabi (Bangkok to Munich and back). Both flights with Etihad gave me only 2 hours transit. It was a nice experience from and to my destination. The new part of the terminal was clean crowd free and easy to navigate through. I guess I was lucky to bypass the rush hour. WCs clean fair amount of shopping and a couple of food venues. Security fast and efficient. A good airport to fly through.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,In and out of Terminal 3 this week. Very poor facilities for food and drink. In duty free I looked at cameras and Ipods. Both seemed expensive and on checking my preferred items they are cheaper on the UK High Street than so called duty free in Abu Dhabi. Buyer beware!,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,The view of this airport may depend on what terminal you arrive and depart from. I was a transiting passenger at the new Terminal 3. This is a terminal with plenty of seating internet access points and adequate duty free. Security was quick and easy and the terminal had plenty of toilets which were clean. I'm not sure what the rest of the airport is like but if you are travelling through Terminal 3 it was a very pleasant experience.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I had the unfortunate pleasure of having a lay-over at AUH airport Terminal 1 a while ago. The place is small and it was ridiculously crowded and there was no place to sit anywhere. It was in general a very uncomfortable experience with a smoking area so disgusting that even after a 7h flight into AUH I passed up on the chance to smoke. I was glad to just go to the gate (located in between the shops) and wait there. Once the security check was starting it was a men-first situation and the women had to wait until the men had passed through. It was the flimsiest security check I have ever had the metal detectors were beeping quite often but everyone was waved through anyway. Never been happier to get onto a crowded plane just to get away from there.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Terminal 3 may be more unique than Terminal 1 which is like any terminal anywhere in the world admittedly Terminal 1 is more spacious which is a plus and there were numerous powerpoints which I saw a family use to plug in the portable DVD player to keep the kids happy. There were computers in Terminal 1 with free internet access which helped pass the time on my overnight stopover. Security checkpoints were not as traumatic as I expected and all in all it was as bad as I was dreading.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Just a transiting passenger both directions. New terminal is a vast improvement although long walks are required and it's kind of boring. Old terminal building with its interesting but terrifying decor is a shocker. Advice: Toilets upstairs are far better than those downstairs (the worst I've ever seen at any airport). Coming back Business Class lounge and transfer hotel OK.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,A lot better since the new terminal 3 has opened. A lot more spacious and even at their busiest time between 11am - 3pm not a problem. a few duty free shops and places to grab something to eat. not bad at all compared to T1.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,A fine airport with all the mod cons if a little cramped for the volume of customers currently using it. The unique architecture is a welcome break from the beige and glass structures so common in modern airports and although the facilities are spartan they fulfil the purpose. The staff are heplful and pleasant with the exception of security. However I've had far more unpleasant experiences with security personnel at other transit hubs in the region these guys should are par for the course.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Having the displeasure of using this airport a couple of times I have now preferred using Dubai and that is saying something. Extremely dull airport ridiculously tacky terminal which has no space at all. Can get very crowded. Toilets are horrid. There's been talk of expansion and the little expansion that has happened is barely noticeable (more check-in counters at departure). Rude officials at arrivals and I have had my bag searched every time I have come through here. Etihad is a nice airline to fly and it's a shame that it is served through this sad excuse for an airport.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I had to go through this airport during my flight from KUL to DUB. Inbound at 8-45pm and outbound at 2-55am - horrible. It took me 30mins from bus to the terminal and once the bus had set down the crowd of people in the bus were lost - where was the exit? The alley used to enter the terminal was also used to go on board and there were no signs dividers. We managed to find our way through by asking for directions to other passengers who were going onboard. As for the terminal itself like all reviews below avoid it at all costs. No seats and if any very uncomfortable seats plus annoying announcements every minute - it gets more annoying if you can't find a place to sit. The duty free shops are a rip-off too. It takes 10 mins to get around the airport and with its dome shape and tiles on the walls the noise echoes throughout and with the announcements its a nightmare! The security checks were over- secured and literally for every passenger they took about 5 mins to interview asking why did you transit in AUH why are you going there how long did you stay in your destination etc.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Hanging around in any airport is to be avoided and in Abu Dhabi all the more so. It is a deeply boring place to have to spend any time there being nothing much to do. The seating – what there is of it – is comfortable. The airport seems tiny. The mosaic dome makes a change but it allows voices to echo so is noisy. This is exacerbated by the continual – and I mean continual – announcements which are also impossible to understand. There is a Costa so you can get a good cup of coffee and pay in £ if you wish. I didn’t particularly notice the smoke that so many people have complained of. Crowd control is southern ie long queues and lengthy processes. The toilets are reasonably unpleasant. Shopping is very limited to the usual Duty Free fare of watches perfumes cigars and alcohol. There are no quiet places to sleep so if you have an 8 hour stop-over during the night as I did you are going to have little fun. You can get a little sleep on the carpeted floor in the passages to the gates. All in all an experience that is not recommended.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,Etihad was a pleasant experience travelling between Sydney and Manchester but the stopover in Abu Dhabi was a big disappointment. Had 2 hours to spend here in either direction and found the airport to be small crowded noisy and smelling of cigarette smoke. Finding a seat and getting comfortable was next to impossible and hearing the announcements over the humdrum was difficult too. Hopefully the new terminals and expansions will do justice to the airline that the airport serves.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I flew with Etihad from BRU to BKK with a 2 hours stopover in AUH. At first sight I found the terminal quite original and nice (the green mosaic); but tiny and really overcrowded. The terminal is non smoking but this is theory as it smells cigarette smoke everywhere. In fact there are smoking areas in bars but no smoke extractor so the whole terminal looks like a smoking room. Going from the 2nd floor to the 1st one using the stairs is hazardous as smoking is not prohibited in the piano bar between the 2 floors. Toilets are on the 1st floor. There look really old fashioned and are not so clean (lot of water on the ground). So what to do when you are in transit? There are 3 bars/snacks but it's almost impossible to find a seat. Prices for drinks are OK. Not so many duty free areas. Ideal for short stopovers as it takes only 5 minutes to go from one gate to another but probably the worst airport I've ever seen for people in transit. I expected much better for a city like Abu Dhabi.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I went through this airport a few weeks back on my way to London from Abu Dhabi on Qatar Airways and to be honest it is one of the most disgusting airports I have been through. My flight was at around 11:30 pm and the airport was crowded and finding a place to sit was out of the question. It is way too cramped and crowded. It is a real shame that a fast developing country like the UAE does not have a decent airport to go through it is not as if Dubai is any better.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Abu Dhabi,I have travelled through Abu Dhabi between London and South East Asia several times over the last few months. A layover here is as recorded elsewhere deeply unpleasant when it is overcrowded (typically 10pm to 2am). Use Qatar or Emirates to their hubs rather than Etihad. The only good thing I have to report is that a critical comment left in their suggestion box stimulated an e-mail apology and promise of better things post the completion of new facilities which arrived before I got back home 12 hours later!,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Singapore,"Not Verified |  Singapore airport is magnificent and extremely well-maintained with its facilities, gardens, waterfalls, etc., but arriving in the country has been made very difficult for Nordics. There is no one at the immigration department, upon arrival you first have to fill out a variety of information in English on a small computer, which can take up to an hour. If the machine accepts everything, be happy. There was no one to assist you in the queue of dozens of people at the machines. And if you are accepted, you go to another automatic machine, where you present your passport and other necessary documents. Your bag has been spinning for a long time waiting for you to pick it up from the belt. When leaving the country, everything seemed to be OK, but then the departure security check began, which was anything but friendly. The border control officers, who were clearly enjoying it, gave orders and ripped off the jackets of older people who did not obey at the same second. A military-style, manly, arrogant woman took my passport and boarding pass away because they noticed my diabetes pills, everything was drugs to them. Then I was ordered aside and subjected to various tactile tests with a digital device. They couldn't, didn't care to read prescriptions. Overall, it had the feel of being in the military chain of command.",2,Arrival and Departure,December 2024,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,3,4,3,2,4,1

Singapore,"Not Verified | I want to express my disappointment regarding my recent experience with the early check-in process at Terminal 1 on December 7, 2024 at around 1.00-2.00 PM, for Thai Airways flight TG408. Upon arriving at the early check-in counter around 1:30 PM, I was met with an unexpectedly rude and unprofessional attitude from the staff member. After weighing my luggage and confirming that it was within the allowed limit, I was surprised when she immediately sent my luggage away without allowing me a chance to verify the weight or receive a luggage tag. When I attempted to ask questions, I was met with dismissive responses such as, ""It's already inside, you go inside yourself,"", ""It's your problem now; find your own solution."" ""You dont like, you can report to any department you like, I dont care"" This lack of communication and support was not only frustrating but also felt disrespectful. Given that there were only 2-3 passengers at the counter at that time, I found it particularly concerning that I was treated this way. Unfortunately, this incident did not end there. Upon arriving in Thailand, I discovered that my luggage had gone missing. I had to wait for the airline to search for it, which added significant stress to my travel experience. As a frequent traveler who has always appreciated Changi Airport's reputation for excellent service, I never expected to encounter such a level of rudeness and disregard. I believe that customer service training and staff management should be prioritized to ensure that all passengers receive the respectful and attentive service they deserve.",2,Departure Only,December 2024,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,3,4,5,4,4,5,1

Like in all major airport passport control is automated, and the machine did not recognize any person of our group (which entered Singapore in the same airport the day before).

Singapore,Not Verified |  We visited Changi airport both on outbound and return journey's to USA and Europe. The airport is outstanding and easy to see why ranked as 1st or 2nd best in airport rankings. Very large but very well laid out and excellent presentation with multiple facilities and services throughout. Convenient skytrain services and travel walkways to gates and between terminals. Myriad of high end stores and food outlets etc. Well posted advisory signage and notification boards. We deliberately scheduled in 2 x 12 hr stops at Changi between flights on the outbound and return trips and took advantage of the airside hotel which can be booked in 6 hr lots. The Aerotel is on the air side of the airport so no need to pass through customs. They also provide a meal with the booking - not inexpensive but worth looking at. Rooms are spacious and very quiet.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified |   Terrible food choices only two places to get coffee or breakfast in T1 about a mile apart and very long queues Singapore has a coffee culture but this doesn’t exist at the airport and doesn’t seem to offer any real breakfast options when a lot of people will be travelling early in the morning. No modern water dispenser filling stations to fill your own bottle airside only outdate water fountain that cannot fill a bottle, very poor service.

Singapore,"Not Verified |   As an international airport, Changi Airport is very not muslim-friendly. This is because that from Terminal 4 until Terminal 1, even in the Jewel Mall, there is no prayer room for Muslims at all. This airport accepts a lot of Muslim passengers from various countries and even collaborate with Muslim-friendly airline such as Emirates, Turkish Airlines etc., but still, there is no room or space for us Muslims to perform our prayer.

Singapore,✅ Trip Verified |  I was appalled by the behaviour of a security screening lady who snatched my purse from my hand and put it on the screening belt.  Also boarding gate for our flight was changed four times. It is definitely inconvenient for elderly passengers to run from one gate to the other four times. We were getting restless after the third announcement cause we thought what if we don’t hear the announcement if it is changed again. We were relieved when we finally boarded the plane. This is my first time experiencing four times boarding gate change for one flight.,1,Transit,March 2024,Couple Leisure,Transit,4,1,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,1
Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified |  The airport was hot and I felt uncomfortable at times. Staff seem distracted at best with most of them more interested in their phones than in customers. Worst of all, due to the fact that they run security checks at the boarding gate, any drinks you bought in the airport to take on the plane will be taken away from you as you enter into the boarding lounge area just before boarding. You are then kept in a hot room with no access to toilets as you wait to board. Not a pleasant travel experience really.",4,Departure Only,April 2024,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,4,2,4,3,4,4,2
Singapore,✅ Trip Verified |  Security people are so bad. They speak rudely and have an attitude.

This was despite the fact that I just flew in with them from my departure airport and they were checked through to my arrival destination.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified |  It never ceases to amaze me that Changi continues to be voted as the best airport in the world. On the face of it Changi can be a pleasant airport to use. However once you factor in all the illogical rules and regulations plus the appalling signage (actually Singapore in general excels at diabolically stupid signs everywhere, or the opposite, a total lack of signs) the complete lack of staff empathy when anything goes wrong, which is way more often than they would have you believe, it is really a quite ordinary and annoying place to be.",1,Arrival and Departure,February 2024,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1,2,1,4,4,3,1

The customs staff who do the security screening for you at the gate before you board your flight are extremely rude. One of the security personnel was sarcastic and surly. The other security man was extremely rude to me as well.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified |   Terminal 4 is terribly configured and planned compared to the other terminals in this airport. While the other terminals have lots of amenities and convenient transportation, terminal 4 provides the bare minimum. The airport itself is nicely decorated and has a nice interior. Arrival and immigration process was automated but made it even more inefficient. Many passengers were stuck at the machines, creating long line ups. The machines were slow to respond and load, even compared to older machines in other airports. To take the mrt or access other terminals, you have to take a shuttle bus, which is very inconvenient for passengers with big luggages, strollers, and wheelchair. Overall terminal 4 is a disappointment compared to my previous experiences at the other terminals in Changi. Would not recommend using T4.

I need to undergo a security check at before boarding. I was asked to remove my jacket and my shoes for scanning purpose. After the scanning process I took my jacket and shoes aside to put on but the Civil Aviation Staff at the airport yell at me telling me that I should not remove the tray from the belt and I should just put on my jacket and my shoes at the belt area. I was concerned that I block others way so I stand aside. There is no place to sit down to put on the shoes after the scanning process and there is no instruction stated that we are not allowed to remove the tray from the belt.

Singapore,"Not Verified |  What a disappointment when I landed at T2 and no proper signage to direct passengers to their respective terminals so I jumped into the aerotrain between terminals and tried my luck and got off the next stop. Staff were  unable to speak properly in English, some information counters were manned by two staff who were chatting away and when I asked for assistance to find which terminal my next flight was, they replied with their hand gesture and nothing was spoken.

Singapore,✅ Trip Verified |  I was in an accident and require a wheelchair. I travel often. Every single airport has nice service where staff take me to the gate. All my family checked in and went through security a few hours early so we can have lunch together before the flight. Then the staff inform me that they cannot push wheelchair until 1 hour before departure. So they leave me alone sitting for more then 1.5 hours with nobody to help. I cannot go toilet. Cannot eat with my family. I realize wheelchair service is a courtesy. But there’s no reason why they make people wait for 1 hour until departure. This doesn’t help anyone. I have traveled to at least 6 other airports in the region and none of them made me do this.,1,Departure Only,October 2023,Family Leisure,Departure Only,1,1,1,N/A,N/A,1,1

There is also a staff that refuse to help even though I have not tell him what do I need and he just go and told me to go inside because ""he is not sure"". Like what are you not sure about?

However, this is the first time I have visited since they rolled out the fully automated arrivals declarations and the automatic biometric gates and it is absolutely awful. Basically the technology is not up to the task (constantly crashes and jams), older people struggle with following the computerized instructions, and staff are unbelievably rude and unhelpful. The whole process actually makes you feel like you are entering or exiting a police state. We had awful technology fails and rude unhelpful staff both arriving at (from memory) Terminal 2 and departing from Terminal 3.

Today, I arrived at Terminal 4 with my 5-year-old and stood in line at immigration. Finally, it was my turn, but the computer system malfunctioned. The immigration officer asked a colleague managing the queue for assistance, and a lady officer who was on duty around 8 pm helped us to another counter. However, she then directed me to rejoin the new queue. I explained that it wasn't fair, especially with a child, but she became defensive, telling me not to throw a tantrum. I hadn't even raised my voice; I was simply trying to convey that I shouldn't have to rejoin the queue. Unfortunately, she lacked empathy and ignored our situation. I believe she could benefit from additional training and better handling of situations when there's a system error, rather than making passengers like me feel like i am at fault.",1,Arrival Only,September 2023,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,5,N/A,3,0,N/A,N/A,1

Before my flight I check if there were food options for gluten free on Singapore airport website they stated that there were option 5 so I thought I would be fine in packing lighter however once reaching the airport I went to all the recommended places and none of them had anything gluten free. Therefore over my 5 hour stop over I was unable to eat anything. Changi airport should update their website to be reflective of what is available.

The terminal you are leaving from changes constantly and nothing to let you know. Multiple full security check. Last one as you are boarding which is why your boarding time is more than an hour prior to take off. I'm currently sitting in a small waiting room with the rest of the plane occupancy after having gone though security again. This means I have no water and couldn't relax. Have my passport and boarding card ready. Take all my electronics out and shoes off. Flying with Singapore Airlines I had previously rated them as one of the best and most comfortable.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Always a pleasure to either depart or land at Changi. Scrupulously clean, well sign posted, easy access to the terminals with the skytrain, excellent variety of shops and restaurants and helpful airport personnel. My only negative is the Terminal 1 airport pool. It is a bonus to have the use of a pool, in pleasant surroundings and the pool itself is very well maintained. In the many years I have used this pool transiting through Singapore, inevitably the admission price has risen - from SD $5.00 to SD $27.00 and no longer includes with the admission price a free drink and the pool opening hours have been reduced. I accept these changes but I do think for the very expensive admission price the women’s changing room is well below par. No cubicles to get changed and therefore no privacy, one small bench to put one’s belongings whilst getting changed, lockers that are awkwardly positioned (and two were broken)so pool users have to jostle for position to use them, two hairdryers that did not work (I reported this to pool staff) and the area was clean but not up to Changi standards. Part of the changing room is also visible from the pool side area.",9,Departure Only,May 2023,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Not Verified |  Had an outbound flight on MH from Changi Terminal 1. Departure gate D38 is shared with D48 and D49 with common entrance and security screening. At the time i was to enter the gate, there were two flights - MH and FinnAir - open for boarding. Two queues were formed, with NO signage indicating whether there was any specific queue meant for FinnAir and the other for MH. The only sign was for FinnAir Priority pointing to the left queue. Both queues were long and slow (5 min to reach the gate check before entering). Passengers were mixed up. Since the Finnair Priority sign pointed to the left queue, i chose the right queue for my MH flight (not that there was any other sign saying where passengers should queue). Unfortunately for me, after queuing 5 minutes and reaching the officer at the entrance (checking the boarding pass), I was told I was in the wrong queue and had to queue again at the back of the other. Another 5 min to queue and get past security check. Luckily still had a few minutes to get in before closing. There is one lady staff going around asking people to put away the trolley, don't eat whilst queuing, empty pockets etc but she also didn't tell people the correct queues. When asked, she had to think before suggesting the queue. Despite being a world class airport, Changi seems inexperienced in managing shared gates - lack of adequate signage, not service friendly to allow passenger to proceed for security checks (which was also shared at the common gate area), and no early information on the segregated queue and the one Priority sign pointing to wrong queue. Lucky I still got through queuing twice in time for boarding. Epic fail in queue management and customer service.",1,Departure Only,April 2023,Business,Departure Only,5,3,1,0,N/A,3,1

As far as I've read, the only requirement for a US citizen to board a flight back to the US us a valid US passport and I had that. My partner who was traveling alongside me was also not asked to produce her driver's license. Please train your staff better. Another security staff near the departure gate tried to grab my boarding pass out of my hands. I assume she did so for additional security checks. However, she did not use her words.

The shopping area was nice and well put together but we didn’t find a variety of food options (past immigration).

Self Service Immigration Lanes were a complete joke. Couldn't clear through the lanes smoothly, had to try different lanes due to unspecified errors, some even had to be called for manual processing. Due to all these humanless process being utilised, when facing errors, staff was hard to come by. Changi has lost its touch in terms of the Singapore hospitality for sure.

Don't rely, as I did, on the assurances of check-in staff at your initial departure point, that 45 mins would be plenty of time, or that the first and second flights arrived and departed from the same terminal. They didn't. My first flight was late, the second flight was in a different terminal, and to complicate matters, the next flight requires security checks to be done at the next gate.

Singapore,✅ Trip Verified |  Overall it was a good experience with Changi. Not all shops were open yet but you still can had a good shopping experience in it. The only issue spotted was staff handling boarding weren't talking professionally to passengers. I understood that one could easily get exhausted and angry when he/she had to explain again and again only rear rows were boarding especially the airline didn't print group number on the boarding pass. But one could also easily resolve it by writing the boarding rows on an A4 paper.

Despite this, I did have somewhere quiet and comfortable, and was able to get something nice to eat. Kudos to the staff who were welcoming and friendly. I would definitely stay there again.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified |  Let's talk about the boarding procedure at Changi Airport Terminal 3. Users of Changi will know the security for flights at Changi is typically at the individual Departure Gate. Unlike at other airports where it tends to be before entering the Terminal (either as a transit passenger or a passenger departing the country). At Terminal 3 they've decided to do all the security for 4 gates, you are then in this little pig pen with 3 other flights, potentially 1500 people, it's not big enough. The lines for the different flights cross each other, and there is little by way of organisation. No one seemed to be in charge, when I politely mentioned it didn't seem very organised I was met with a blank stare. I didn't expect this at Changi Airport. I have been in other airports in the South East Asian region which were chaotic, and where the queuing system had broken down, with people pushing into lines ahead of others who had waited patiently, on one occasion barely making my flight. Changi, though, is a byword for excellence. Who is in charge there? What was the motivation for cramming 4 flights into a pig pen?",3,Arrival and Departure,February 2022,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,3,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,1

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified |  A bad experience transiting through Changi airport. Airport is great with all the shops and cozy places to eat. Despite it all, my last two times in transit through Changi airport I'll never forget the rude service from immigration staff. I just gently touched the autogate door and the person in charge standing in front warned me that if I broke it I would have to pay for it. Second time also in transit, when it was my turn to check my passport the immigration staff complaints that my passport cover is so big. He needs to take my passport out of my cover. If unwilling to do just let me know. It is just an super easy thing to do!",3,Transit,February 2020,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,4,3,4,4,4,N/A

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | I was flying on LOT Polish Airlines from Singapore to Warsaw. At the very beginning I visited Jewel which in my opinion should be in the airside for the transit passangers. When I finally decided to get to the airside it turned out that they couldn't scan my electronic boarding pass and I had to wait in an incredibly long queue, which was a huge inconvenience. The airport staff were really helpful though. They explained that we have to wait in the line, because they can’t scan our boarding pass, because they don’t have this airline in their system, which in my opinion is nothing but pathetic. If the airport serves an airline, it should be in their system. This airport is very overrated and 'likes to fly, but forgets how to walk' - it’s spectacular, but doesn’t offer basic airport services like scanning electronic boarding passes.",5,Departure Only,February 2020,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,5,2,5,1,4,3,5
Singapore,"Not Verified |  I arrived into the airport and had a 24-hour layover until my next flight. I decided to leave the airport, explore the city, and then come back into the airport to relax before the flight. First off, the airport is massive!! There is so much to do and it's very entertaining, but it's so big that it's almost impossible to find your way around and everything is ridiculously expensive. I had to keep on asking staff where things were and when I checked the maps, it was hard to follow and it seemed like nothing matched the images. When I arrived back into the airport, I checked with my airline (Scoot) if my luggage will make it back to my flight, or if there is anything I need to do to make sure it will make it okay. They said there was nothing to worry about and it has already been transferred to my gate. I had time to kill, so I decided to take a shower. I found the little icon on the map and went to the respective areas to find the showers and they were not to be found. I asked the lounge staff where they are and they said I needed to pay $20 for a shower that is was inside the lounge. Not ideal. I wanted to see some of the attractions inside of the airport, but they were all way too expensive to enjoy. I went on the high bridge walk to watch the water and light so and it was $8 for about a 30 meter walk. This was the cheapest attraction, but by far the shortest. When it comes time to board, the carry-on checks is actually at the gates. The staff were very rushed and not making it a smooth process. They were very rude, no matter how prepared you were with your laptop out, jacket off, and all metal off. After the check-in point, we were held like cattle in a little room without many charging ports, so everyone was piling on top of each other for the littlest charge they could get. When I arrived at my destination, my checked luggage did not. I asked luggage services where it was at and they said my bag did not make the 24 hour connection. How could it not make it? If I knew I was not going get my checked bag, I would have done the transfer myself. I do not understand why the Scoot team told me it was transferred no problems, when it clearly was not. Long story short, the airport is confusing, glamorous, but not hassle free. I came into way more issues with this ""luxury"" airport than I did with other airports. It was cool to come here once, but I will try my best to do go again.",5,Arrival and Departure,February 2020,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,3,2,3,N/A,4,2
Singapore,Not Verified |  Whilst Changi offers lots of shops and food to distract from long waits it seems to be short of seating. It feels like there are less seats available each time I pass through. Is it to keep people shopping or to encourage memberships to the lounges? Wifi is great. Comfort and places to rest without having to spend money are scarce.,4,Transit,January 2020,Solo Leisure,Transit,4,1,3,3,4,5,4
Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | All I have to say is, what an airport! Just Jewel in and of itself means Changi is a tourist destination, with a 130-some-odd foot-tall indoor waterfall consisting of recycled rainwater, surrounded by five stories of tropical plants that appeal to multiple senses and then seven stories of what's basically a big, opulent shopping mall. Said shopping area also contains a Yotel, supermarket, IMAX theatre (below ground!), and access to an upper-level plant walk, which includes a glass bridge overlooking the waterfall, and a huge massive net suspended in the air that you can jump on. I spent an entire day in Jewel just as a tourist. But exploring the terminals is also a treat. Terminal 3 itself would be one of the most beautifully-designed airports in the world, with the sound-breaking ceiling, incredible space for passengers to walk around in, and plenty of shops post-security. The staff working in shops and restaurants, whether pre-security, in Jewel, or post-security, are, for the most part, nice, helpful and respectful. Also, terminal 2 had a beautiful display to celebrate this Year of the Rat pre-security, and a beautiful, rooftop sunflower garden post-security. The flow between the terminals requires either a walk or a tram or bus ride, but the organization at this airport is very logical. Customs and immigration aren't the friendliest, but they are efficient, courteous, and don't have a determinable ounce of the hostility that I'd expect to encounter with American and Canadian agents. However, processing times coming into Singapore for C&I weren't very efficient, even though lines weren't long at all, so I have to take one point off the overall rating. Baggage pickup is very efficient. I was able to pre-check baggage in Jewel before flying to Hong Kong--very easily, all computer-based, and with more than four hours to spare before departure time. Departure security, interestingly, is done at the gate, which is unusual, but the security personnel were personable, friendly, efficient, and thorough, all simultaneously. Singapore Airlines staff at departure were also very helpful and professional. Any place I saw in the airport was meticulously clean; even the restrooms had large windows in front of the urinals, but bamboo plants to block any views either inside or outside. Wow, I mean, wow! I wish North America would get its act together and build something even resembling Seoul Incheon or Hong Kong International, let alone Changi.",9,Arrival and Departure,January 2020,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,5,4

Singapore,Not Verified |  Changi has sorted everything re waiting time for immigration etc but doesn’t help that you can speed through that and then have to wait for the conveyor belt to find an open spot to keep the luggage coming out.

Singapore,✅ Trip Verified | Everything was great at the airport until I saw an airport vehicle travelling at high speed that sped past WHSmith (11.45am). The 2 staff were giggling and chatting while the vehicle was speeding past walking tourists. It is dangerous and they seem to be unaware of the surrounding. The speeding was to drop off a staff member at the escalator in front of WHSmith. This is really uncall for. It would be disastrous if the vehicle accidentally hit a walking tourist.

Immigration queue was a long wait of about 35-40 minutes despite there being only about 5 people in the line. Singapore talks a lot about efficiency but they can't even handle a queue in an efficient manner. And then comes the immigration officers at arrival who interrogate you as if you're here to vandalise their country despite frequent attempts at repeating that you're a tourist and here for only 4 days. This is also the only airport I've ever been to that scans you and your bag immediately upon arrival, with the workers treating you like pigs going to slaughter. Funny how they rush you at the scan and treat your belongings like dirt but when you get to the immigration counter, they make you wait for a century before you finally step outside.",2,Arrival and Departure,November 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,5,2,2,3,1
Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible experience at Changi. Arrived in terminal 1 for a transfer in terminal 4. I had to walk like 20 minutes dragging a suitcase over plush carpet (which makes it very difficult to roll a suitcase). Then had to check in to take a bus. Yes, a bus! To terminal 4! The boarding of the bus was weird. Three officials poured over all my documents (passport, incoming and outgoing boarding passes) and writing information in a notebook. With a pen! In the 21st century and in supposedly the best airport in the world! Then I had to wait 20 minutes for a bus that took forever and took so many turns I got nauseous. I’ve experienced a better transfer experience in Sudan for crying out loud! Also weird: security right before boarding in some places, and, you have to wait for an official to give you a tray so that you can take the laptoup out, etc. The airport is pretty and elegant, but very time consuming and like being stuck in a time warp. Sad.",4,Departure Only,November 2019,Business,Departure Only,5,2,2,3,2,4,2

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Arriving in Singapore Changi is always a delight. The thoughtfulness that is put into making the experience as good as possible should be a blueprint for all airports. Immigration was so fast with only two in front of me, and by the time I got to the luggage belt my bag was there. I love that the belts are flattish so there is no rim to lift your bag over. Everything a traveller could need including ATM and SIM card purchase plus money exchange is there before you leave. The taxi system is efficient and fast with no big line ups. Departing is a little more laborious showing your boarding pass and passport several times before you enter airside. It was almost comical as I was the only one there at the time and each time the person who asked to see these things saw me producing such for the preceding check. Many sleep on the chairs I noticed early morning. However there is much to enjoy in this airport before a flight. While you get the carry on/bag check at the gate, there is water to fill up your bottle just after this. Personally I’d also like to see a vending machine too. Despite little annoyances this airport deserves its status as being the best. If you have time basement 2 landside has a supermarket, cheaper stores and many eateries.",10,Arrival and Departure,September 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,N/A,5
Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | I suffered most of the Changi terminals in the last week and none were better than atrocious. I suspect this airport isn't about making travellers lives easier but rather providing an experience to infrequent travellers. Starting with the main terminal T3 arrived on an SQ overnight flight. The flight is delayed- so wander out to immigration. No sign of any staff- 13 desks, 2 with officials at which point one leaves. 10 minutes later they troop out - bearing in mind our flight was delayed so we can't have caught them by surprise. Luggage slow to appear and eventually get out and into taxi rank - few taxis, taxi marshall sent me to one, get in and halfway down the highway he says I have chosen a luxury vehicle at $60, normal taxi is $25. Next up - flight on Silkair to Surabaya. T2. Chaos at parking outside, no clear signage inside and eventually find a desk. Check-in and head off to immigration. Now in the queue from hell - we are all told to use e-gates, so in long queue although there are only two gates operational. Many people cannot use e-gates but they are made to try several times before they are allowed to give up. They new it wouldn't work but the immigration staff enjoyed watching them fail. Get to scan my prints - not working so I am sent to a new queue which is like Spanish Inquisition. Finally, get into terminal lots of shops but no useful facilities. Make way to the lounge and it is a shambles. Eventually, get on a flight having enjoyed the ""how many times do we x-ray you and you bag game"" Next up landing from Surabaya - obviously this is a destination (along with some Indian ones) where they treat you really badly. Off a late evening flight, x-rayed before I set foot outside arrival gate then it's off on a long and winding journey to get my bag. Finally departing T1 on EK. So chaotic arrival at the front door, with no clear signage of which zone to go to. Eventually, check-in. Lost the will to live with trolley. No staff available to help, but they do have lovely waterfalls to look at! Approached someone claiming to be customer service, abrupt and rude. Have usually delights of security with inefficiency guaranteed. Finally, get on the plane having been examined by security again. In summary, inefficient immigration, and obsession with security (but they don't actually pay attention to the screens they are too busy chatting), certainly dislike some destinations, surly staff and possibly ripped off in a taxi. However, lots of shopping (except Marina Mall is much better), some nice greenery and actually very good wifi.",4,Arrival and Departure,October 2019,Business,Arrival and Departure,2,N/A,2,3,5,5,3
Singapore,"Not Verified | I'm entering a bit of serious criticism in this review. Let me first say that I think Changi Airport is amazing in almost every regard, but I'm having a major issue with the system in the past year or so flying in an out of Terminal 4. ISSUES: Arriving Terminal 4 and needing to transit to Terminal 3. It's confusing, difficult, and a long and exhausting process, especially in non-peak hours. I've arrived in Terminal 4 on a long international flight in the early morning hours, with a wait for my next flight on a regional flight on a different airline. There is no Transit hotel in Terminal 4, so if I want to get a good nights sleep, I needed to go to Terminal 3 at the only hotel at the airport, Crowne Plaza. It's expensive, and I've sometimes had to pay over $300/USD for a room (w/no b'fast), to sleep, shower and refresh. It's a great hotel, but overpriced. There are no other options at the airport. Getting from Terminal 4 to Terminal 3 is a burden. 1. Need to go through immigration and proceed to a shuttle bus waiting area. During the day the bus comes often, but at night, you have to wait quite a while. 2. Haul your luggage on to a bus. No assistance with this. (Sometimes travel is done with my wife and her bags are always heavy.) 3. Alight at Terminal 2. 4. Then walk above the Subway System from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. Ok. It can be done, but it isn't easy, especially after flying on long haul flights and arriving in the early morning hours. Singapore's Changi needs to get a better system for transiting from T4 to other terminals, and for $300/night, Crowne Plaza should provide a shuttle to pick up passengers. All said, I've lived and worked in Singapore and besides this big problem, I've always had a great airport experience, as I've traveled in and out of Singapore so many times. The Jewel terminal (mall) is stunning beyond belief. There is no place like it in the world. Singapore is a great place to be.",8,Transit,October 2019,Business,Transit,5,3,3,3,5,3,5

Singapore,✅ Trip Verified | This airport gets many great reviews but I consider that these are from passengers in premier or legacy airline movements. Transfer on low cost carriers is somewhat different experience. Lack of toilet facilities with long distance walks makes for an uncomfortable experience. The lack of signage that is easily understood is still a problem at Changi. I know where to go but first time visitors get confused over terminal numbers against letters of the alphabet to prefix gates.

However our experience at the taxi queue and whatever its intended design left us hot and flustered and we are embarrassed by its world class claim and visitors get to experience the same farce as us. Firstly it is already a terrible idea having visitors to pick which of the 4 queues they hope would be the fastest when all the other terminals have logical queue system in place. Then in order to counter this poor idea and design, you have to have so many staff trying hard (and very unsuccessfully at times) to direct users and explaining to them why (some lines are closing they say) and which queues to go to, adding confusion, irritation and frustration to people just coming down the escalators and those already waiting in line. Having this terrible system in place, where you have created very unequal number of people amongst the 4 queues, we imagine the other logical thing to do hire more staff just to direct taxis waiting outside which queue to approach first? And even that we can see that their decision making didn't reflect on the situation at hand. We were directed to the longest queue and yet the taxis coming our way were the least! After about 45 mins of waiting, my partner and I decided to split so that she could join another queue which seems shorter and before long she was already near the end of her line while I still had loads of people in front of me. Naturally I left my line and joined her and we finally got our cab. This was more than an hour of waiting for a taxi at Singapore Changi Airport! We are really baffled by your adopted queueing concept which is an old system that has been and still is a failure anywhere in the world and wondered whose bright idea it was to bring it to Terminal One when the queue system in all the other 3 terminals worked logical and efficiently. What a waste of manpower and resources. Please do something about it.",5,Arrival Only,April 2019,Couple Leisure,Arrival Only,5,5,5,5,5,4,5

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Beautiful airport with many amenities. If you transit for more than 4 hours I believe, please take advantage of the benefits they offer. We received S$20 to use to purchase gifts. It is like they want you to spend the money for souvenirs. I love that. Unfortunately, we also arranged for transit for more than five hours, and we planned on getting to the free city tour, but they were all booked.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Being a Singaporean, I use this airport many times, and every time it comes as no surprise that Changi AIrport can clinch the Best Airport of the year, 6 years in a row. The airport was very clean, the staff there was very helpful, and check in was very efficient and within 20 mins of entering the airport I was in the departure area. One of the highlights that makes Changi Airport is their relentless effort to improve - everywhere I see tablets asking tourists to leave a review of how they have done, and the signs were big and placed in very strategic areas, and I had no problems following them to my destination. On arrival, it was the same - half an hour after I stepped off my flight I was in the public area - no airport I have been to can match this efficiency, or even come close to doing so. The Wifi was very readily available and fast - no problems. Overall, I would recommend anyone passing through this airport to come earlier and spend more time roaming around inside - it is truly more than just an airport, and definitely deserves that award.",10,Arrival and Departure,December 2018,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

Only Singaporean citizens and residents are permitted to use the electronic gates, rest of us had to queue up to have our passports stamped and finger prints recorded. For some unknown reasons, it was so slow today on Feb 15th, it took me nearly an hour to go through the process, I'd thought I was in Vietnam or Bali, some third world airport!

Singapore,"Not Verified |  Singapore airport may boast a magnificent building and efficient infrastructure, but it has some of the most unfriendly service I have experienced. There is a persistent sense of being policed rather than serviced, queues are long, and visa and travel permission verifications by the airlines at departure feel much more like interrogation than like a courteous routine check. It also takes forever. There is much more concern for executing miriads of safety procedures and often intrusive checks than for the comfort of the passengers.",6,Departure Only,January 2019,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,5,5,5,3,3,4,1

The quality of food, however, is commendable. Duty free shops are also aplenty in the departure area. I managed to get a earphone from the duty free shops. I also managed to buy a sweater at the shops there. Immigration was swift. Security checks are done at the gate.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | A fantastic airport albeit a few shortcomings, especially if you're using the older terminals (1,2,3), more on which later. Of my 10+ visits to Singapore across all the 4 terminals, the quality of service was always better the last time I flew. Signage- On point, Staff Politeness & Help: On Point, Cleanliness (Terminal) - On Point, Cleanliness (Restrooms) - On Point, Shopping Option - On Point, Eatery Option - On Point. They even have a free Singapore Tour for passengers with transit duration > 5:30 hours. Terminal 4 is a masterpiece and Singaporeans are on the verge of converting into a world's first automated terminal. The only drawback is security checks just at the gate at the older terminals and they're quite strict about everything. I had stocked up on water from 7/11 and I was made to throw it at the gate. My point being, why sell water bottles at the airport when you're not even allowed to carry it onboard. I've flown from more than 50+ airports and have never come across such a weird policy before Overall, a fantastic airport for travelers. A long transit should not be a concern.",9,Arrival and Departure,November 2018,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,4,5

Singapore,"Not Verified |  It is a beautiful airport with lots of shopping. But I am very disappointed overall with disposition of staff in Singapore overall and definitely here in Changi. They seem all on a mission to sell without the niceness you'd expect (think Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam). Because customer service is important to me the experience here is definitely not a 10.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Amazing airport with a few basic flaws. Walking through here is like walking through a nice shopping mall. Clean and plentiful bathrooms, play areas for kids. Plenty of help if you need. Efficient immigration staff. Not a fan of the carpet but not a big deal. The two main gripes I have about this lovely airport are: Lack of charging outlets. Not everyone wants to shop and eat and I would like to get some work done if I have an hour at the airport. No charging outlets in main areas, there are only a few at the gate where hundreds of people sit waiting to board, and then a few small isolated charging stations sprinkled in random areas throughout the airport. Really, Changi? After everything else they think of, they can do better than this and its practically a requirement now for airports to provide convenient charging access. Annoying Wifi hookup. Like I said, not everyone wants to shop and eat. They make you provide a phone number to text but my phone doesnt receive certain texts for some odd reason. So now I have to walk around the airport to find a kiosk and scan my passport to get a code that it only in use for a limited time. Hugely inefficient and annoying. What is the point of this? Most other airlines just let you log onto the wifi without requiring passwords to be sent individually to each person. Love the airport but I can't ignore these two basic things that ruin the experience for me. Just get more convenient charging access and wifi access and I am happy, don't need all those fancy stores.",7,Departure Only,January 2019,Family Leisure,Departure Only,5,5,5,4,5,1,5

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified |  The best in the world. Cleanliness, information screen can be easily found. The travellator and sky train make passengers easily to move around. It's like a wonderful home to all passengers with facilities ranging from butterfly garden to swimming pool to cinema and the list goes on. Staff are friendly and attentive to help passengers. I will definitely come back again. It's worth for me to spend some extra hours here before flying home. My only suggestion is the work or improve a bit of the flight information screen. It took really some time to find our flight if the flight is code-shared with the other airlines. For example, I'm flying to KUL from SIN with Silk Air, and the flight was code shared with other alliance airlines and too many flight numbers and airline logos are changing/moving. I may oversee it if I don't spend longer time checking the info screen. This also happened to two passengers too. They wanted to fly to Chennai, the husband remembered it was a silk air flight, however, the wife was struggling as she didnt find their gate as they kept looking for Silk Air's logo.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Changi is a wonderful airport and has tons of awesome amenities and some very cool, unique features that you don't see at most other airports. I must give them points for its highly immaculate cleanliness, however, the departure process is confusing, maddening and quite disorganized. I don't know if this is airline specific, but the security/metal detectors are positioned at the actual boarding gates and the staff who oversee the security and boarding process at these gates are extremely disorganized. This was my second trip to Singapore in a year and I'm stunned at how inefficient the boarding process is once you get to your gate. It's just chaos and frustration. What is the deal? The gate agents also call out boarding groups but don't give them enough room to assemble without being on top of each other. In my case, they called Boarding Group 2 then 3 then 2. Is it me?

Singapore,✅ Trip Verified | I travel on a regular basis to Singapore with Cathay. This flight arrives at the new terminal 4. You would expect a new terminal is designed for the modern traveler. No they did not. They put in a carpet like in the old days in terminal 1. The designer did not think of the modern passenger who travel with bags on wheels. Can you imagine how heavy this is on a carpet to drag your bag around. There is no help from travelators as well. They built in two travelators to get to the last gate so it becomes a long walk on a heavy carpet.

There appear to be quite good restaurants on the other side but they are before you go through security and can’t be accessed from the departure lounge.

Singapore,"Not Verified |  There are several good things to say about Changi Airport. The place is clean, has a very warm and welcoming atmosphere and a direct metro connection to the city centre. There is very much attention to detail, but there was one big thing that spoiled my experience and might make me avoid this airport on future trips to Australia for example: There was no central security check in the terminal, but instead one at every gate. Firstly that means that you can't bring any liquids on the plane other than the free water you get at the gate and secondly - and that is even worse - it means that if you want to use a restroom shortly before your plane departs, you have to leave the gate and go through the security check again when re-entering the gate. Yes, there are no toilets at the gates which is very unusual. So this airport cares for many details, but left out the most essential thing of all. Security checks always are inconvenient and I usually arrive at airports very early to check in and when I complete the security checks, I know that there is no obstacle left between me and the plane. At Changi Airport that is different and that is quite sad.

Singapore,"Not Verified |  ""Best Airport in Asia as well as the Best Airport in the World"". A seriously misleading description for T1. I arrived on Wednesday and was at the immigration queue at around 6 pm. Every row was filled to about 60% of the immigration hall. As I use a walking stick I was directed to the line at the extreme right which included families and people on wheelchairs. Unfortunately there was only 1 immigration officer for that queue. Consequently it took me 1 hour standing in the queue before I was cleared. Kids were crying. It was not a pleasant experience at all. My bag of course was waiting for me when I finally got to the baggage carousel. I thought this was a once of experience. Unfortunately this was not the case. My husband arrived on the same flight 2 days later on a Friday. He was in the regular queue and his experience was exactly the same. It took both of us 1 hour 20 mins from the time we got off the plane to the time we got to the taxi stand.

The helpful girl at the hotel suggested that I first get breakfast and crash out in my room. ATMs were everywhere and I got out some local currency. In the transit area, in addition to the usual expensive airport restaurants was the welcoming Golden Arches of a McDonalds, where I had cheap breakfast. Then I slept for 6 hours! At Changi airport, gates are allocated in such a manner that there are no long walks involved between gates.

In particular, I must mention, the bathrooms are spotless and absolutely clean. There is plenty of shopping available and entertainment is abundant. Connections are swift with the sky train. However, the downfall of this airport is their staff. Rudest and probably the most clueless staff ever.

Free Wifi and Water dispensers are rare to find in most airports in the region and the provision of massage facilities and lounges to relax make the airport an easy transit hub. On the contrary, the staff at the airport are absolutely the worst I have ever come across. The security personal at the gate literally grabbed the security token from me and grabbed my jacket and also barked at many passengers in the line. The airport information desk personal were no different with very blunt and rude responses. Their attitude towards foreign passengers is honestly disgusting and you're better off finding your way around on your own than asking for help because you'll be met with an abrupt response. Airport signs sometimes only appear in English and Mandarin which is odd given that there should be two additional languages that the signs should be displayed in. The washrooms are remarkable and practically spotless and well done to the staff who maintain them. Air conditioning facilities can also be improved.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible transit at Changi Airport from BKK to DPS. There is no segregated departure and arrival levels so arriving and transiting people are on the the same level than departing people, with police cordoning off arriving people, totally surreal. Upon arriving from BKK a first body scan, shoes removed etc. Than afterwards; what a stressful and outdated airport. Moldy and stinky flashy carpet straight out of the 70s. Low ceiling and little natural light. The sheer quantity of duty free shops is creating traffic jams blocking people. There is a lack of seating too. Food is way overpriced. An extremely stressful airport to use for a 3H transit, better keep it shorter unless you like shopping and spending money. Of course, a new body scan at the gate, creating a long queue without seating. Completely outdated airport and a messy transit organisation.",3,Transit,June 2018,Family Leisure,Transit,3,1,2,2,3,4,2
Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | I am currently waiting for departure right now with feelings of annoyance. First of all, the staff at the gate were not very friendly which made me slightly disappointed because I thought that politeness and smiles were essential for passengers to enjoy a pleasant journey. What triggered me was that when I asked a staff to help us with the checking in of luggage, she looked at me and told me to do it myself. In my opinion I think providing basic concern or help would have been important to leaving a good impression of staff's attitude and the airport in general. I then roamed around while waiting for time to pass and when it was time to check in, it really made me fuming mad because the staffs at the bag checking section were really rude and harsh (the male staff rushed me and the female staff asked my sister to take off her cap with a demanding tone as if she were our mother). This experience was bad but I'm glad that a few staff still bothered to work with a polite attitude. I would advise the airport to really focus on their staff recruitment process so that we can have a legitimate ""pleasant journey"".",4,Departure Only,June 2018,Family Leisure,Departure Only,5,4,4,4,3,3,1
Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | First of all, the WIFI service is absolutely horrible, I cannot access the internet even after multiple attempts to reconnect. Secondly, the staff's mannerisms are getting worse from my last trip. I gave this airport 4 stars for the trip before this but when I returned in Feb 2018, the staff were not looking good. The staff in the food court in Terminal 3 were not friendly and they speak to you very loudly in a rude manner. The airport immigration officer in my opinion have mixed reviews. Some of them were polite and they will greet you with a smile. However, some of the staffs mannerisms seemed fake. It is much like they don't really care about customer service but they are forced to do so to show the travellers their manners. The airport staff should also try to stop using words like 'lah', 'nah' which some travellers like me might feel that they are quite rude as this is a customer service and not just chit-chatting.",7,Transit,February 2018,Family Leisure,Transit,5,5,5,5,5,1,2
Singapore,"❌ Not Verified |  We were twice very disappointed at the immigration on arrival. The immigration staff do not show any urgency in doing their work. Many were seen to be chatting and gossiping with one another and the supervisor was just as bad! Having been through China, Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore's immigration service upon arrival really looked and sounded so far behind Vietnam and Cambodia where the officers acted and looked more professional. The queues were long and queue cutting behaviour by arriving passengers was not stopped. I guess when passengers see the immigration officers as so relaxed and sloppy, passengers acted rowdily too. In most other arrival halls, immigration officers are serious and the passengers behave better. Most are surprised to see gossipy and chatting immigration officers in Singapore who are slow at their work processing the check in at arrival halls.",1,Arrival Only,May 2018,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,1,N/A,3,0,N/A,N/A,1

Being senior citizens walking the long distance to catch the skytrain was really tiring. Same thing was repeated on the return journey (T1 to T3). Airport authorities should arrange buggies for such passengers. In fact one buggy was there but the driver refused. It will be of great help if buggy specifically earmarked for senior citizens are on standby.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Departing, going thru Immigration pointed to one of 3 lines, with a few people lined up. Looking at the automated system (very few people using it) and there was no directions or conversations from the humans in charge in who could use it. ""Registered passengers"" is that me? Others in the line talked regarding this as well. Waited 30 min, another couple behind me were determined to test the system and proceeded to leave the line (I heard the gasps from others). I was lined at the red line and the other couple went thru, apparently the thumb prints that were taken on arrival made you a registered passenger.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | I usually travel through Changi every month or so and have done so for the last 7 years. Historically it’s been a pleasant experience with great Singaporean efficiency, but the terminal was a bit dated. I was therefore pleased when Cathay moved its services to the new Terminal 4 late last year. Sadly, although the airport is beautiful, the customer experience is far from being so, mostly marred by the immigration and security teams. I never needed to queue for long upon arriving at Terminal One, but on the last two occasions, the lines at Immigration have been at least 10 deep and the previously polite immigration officials are now sour faced. Despite being given a card to say that I am a registered traveller the first time I visited, the immigration officials now say that I cannot use the automated gates for registered travellers as I have a foreign passport. Upon departing, I can use the automated gates, but they are designed so an alarm goes off if you push your luggage in front rather than behind you, even though most modern cases are designed for you to be able to push it in front of you. The baggage screeners seem to be clueless about what they are doing and as a result, you are stuck at the counter for ages. There are no signs offering guidance on what needs to be removed from hand luggage. Sometimes they ask for liquids to be removed from bags (the only airport I travel to in Asia that requires this and it was never previously a requirement, despite all research now indicating this security measure is no longer required) and sometimes they don’t - in fact when passing through today, I was told to leave them in my bag and after I put my bags on the belt, the woman changed her mind! I also had a tiny cardigan on due to the fierce ac in the airport which I was made to take out and to retrieve my passport and boarding card from my hand luggage because they wanted to put them through security separately! Anyway, after a terrible experience, I asked the supervisor if there were any feedback forms I could complete and I was told no. I queried this and was told to speak to someone at information - but it was closed. Come on Changi Airport, this is not the way to be a world beating airport. I used to sing your praises and encourage people to transit through here, but not any more!",5,Arrival and Departure,April 2018,Business,Arrival and Departure,5,4,3,4,5,2,1
Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | As a transfer passenger between two airlines here, the stopover at Changi Terminal 2 is pleasurable. My flight land at Terminal 3 around midnight, Aerotrain between terminals is out of order but we are well advised what to do. I stayed at Ambassador transit hotel for 6 hours and it is very good too. They seemed to have very limited room, so advance reservation is strongly recommended. On my return journey, my transit is just under 1 hours and I found myself passing 2 security check, one after I deplaned which all passengers of that flight are directed to walk along the barricade to an extra security X-ray machine instead of freely walking to the public area, and then another security screening before boarding at the gate, which surprise me but not really a problem. Food shop here are nice, ranging from luxury option to the local Foodcourt. Good wifi signal and universal power outlet available thorough the terminal.

Singapore,❎ Not Verified |  Arrived early at 3.35am and virtually everything was closed. Noted that the trains don't start until 5.30am approx so had 5 hours to do nothing. Very disappointing as Singapore used to be legendary to transit through. Once cafes and bars did start opening I felt ripped off by the charges so stuck to a can of soft drink.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | This used to be the most efficient airport to travel through, especially for arrivals. Sadly, its no longer the case. On arrival there are long and slow moving lines waiting to go through passport control. There are no e-passport scanners and for some unknown reason they feel the need to take a finger print image.

Singapore,"❎ Not Verified | The best airport to transit through. I would have thought that you were only gonna be allowed to muck around in some stupid lounge. No, Changi lets you roam free. Just amazing. The price for a banana was 1 Singapore Dollar - compare that to European airports (most of them) this airport had a childrens play area, hundreds of bars and restaurants, toyshops. If you have to compare it to some of the other airports, the other ones are like pennies in a moneybox. This one; the money box its self. It's Huge.

Singapore,❎ Not Verified |  Three years since we last were in Singapore. During this time Changi has expanded but is still an excellent and easy airport to spend some time.

Singapore,"❎ Not Verified |  Fantastic airport - truly one of the most efficient in the world. Never has long queues, either in security or immigration (and as a resident, you can use the biometric e-gates for immigration, making the process even faster). For departures, the security is done at the gate, so there are never long queues as you don't have to worry about how many flights are leaving at once. Combined with the immigration, it means you don't need to arrive hours before your flight - if you've checked in online and don't have checked bags, an hour is sufficient. For arrivals, I'm normally in a taxi leaving the airport within 20 minutes of landing (as I don't have bags to wait for). Even with the bags, it doesn't take that much longer. Things to note: as security is at the gates, any drinks purchased in the terminal have to be finished before you get to the gate but you can take empty bottles through security, there are water fountains at the gate, so you can refill before boarding. The toilets outside the gates, so if you need to go, do it before you clear security.",10,Arrival and Departure,December 2017,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,5,4,4,5,N/A
Singapore,❎ Not Verified | The airport does not have security until at the gate so you can't take any drinks onboard.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | I'm unsure what the Changi airport management company are thinking but its sure lost its focus as a user friendly airport. Our flight arrived at 2 am and we needed to wait for the airport MRT, first train departs at 5.30 am to the ferry terminal. We had luggage so we decided to have some very late dinner and wait in the transit area for the first train. After dinner my wife lay on one of the provided loungers, and the next minute the airport police were asking for our passports. I explained we were transiting from the plane to the airport train to which he instructed us we would have to wait outside, and promptly escorted us away. Here we are at now 3.30 am in Singapore, having to wait outside the airport with all our luggage and no way of getting to our next destination.

It is not by accident that Changi airport is confirmed years in a row to be the best airport in the world. All terminals are on the highest levels. Terminal 3 is without doubt the modern one and is very comfortable, especially in combination with Singapore Airlines. Like in most airports, departures is less stressful than arrivals with more or less very long queues. The automated railway connection between terminal 2 and 3 is a prestigious project but does not really make big sense, at least not to me.

To throw away a full bottle of water that I bought after I entered the departure area, just to find vending machines ready to take another $2SGD from me once I pass. Food seriously poor in terms of quality, even from an international chain like Coffee Bean. Terrible. Oversized airport for no apparent reason.

The streetfood place has an idiotic system where you need to go prepay a card, pay for a food, get a refund for the amount left on the card afterwards. There’s 8-10 stalls, is it so hard to have a cashier at each?

In fact, the temperature is pleasant. There two negative issues though, one, the staff are not as good as the airport. They don't live up to your expectations.

Singapore,"✅ Verified Review | Prior to my arrival in Changi, the only thing I heard about this airport was my colleague telling me it was the best airport in the world! So, I didn't have high expectations, but, nevertheless, the first impression was good. This airport is neat, well organised and immigration was fast and efficient. To be honest, that's a real good introduction to Singapore. Of course, on arrival, we spent as little time as possible in the airport but I had way more time on the departure. On my departure day, I spent 7 hours in this airport (my flight was late in the evening and since I got kicked out from the Hotel beginning of the afternoon, I needed a nice place to work and this airport seemed to be perfect to do so). Check-in was super easy, border control was super fast. Without my luggage I was ready to have a look around. First good surprise, all 3 terminals are reachable once you're inside (there's an internal automatic train, but, if you feel like it, you can walk around as well). I found a very nice Cactus bar, outside, in the sun with view on the tarmac and, of course, with lot of cacti! That was the perfect place to work, very pleasant. Once done, I checked the swimming pool (!) that you can access for a little fee. It's a small one, but heck, it's not every day you can use a swimming pool in an airport! (only downside you get to leave with your wet trunk in your backpack....). Apart from that, you got a huge choice of food (""traditional"" street food, fast food, etc), nice spot here and there (Butterfly garden, Koi pond, bars) and a free cinema which is, again, quite unique from my experience, it's running non stop and, even if you don't want to seat two hours in front of a new blockbuster before seating 10 hours in a plane, that's still a funny addition. The only downside to me is the security control at the gate, once done, there's no turning back so, you can say hello to your bottle of water and buy a new tiny one in the only tiny shop available after the control. It's not my preferred way of doing things but, anyway, this is clearly my favourite airport so far!",10,Arrival and Departure,July 2017,Business,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,4,4,5,5

The people working there were rude, the air conditioner did not seem to be working, every passport line was back up to the far back wall. There are many airports in Europe than handle more people quicker than here. The passport room is poorly designed. There are two rows of counters. However, there is no way to access the second row. The second row counter is waving to you but the person in the front row completely blocks you from entering. So what happens is a security officer will randomly choose people on the outside lines to fill in the second row which is not fair. Of course there is no way of knowing this until you are up in the front row. There is nothing that makes waiting in a long line worse than knowing that others are arbitrarily allowed to cut far ahead in line. How is it fair that some wait 10 minutes while others wait 2 hours? Yes, there is a garden and decorations, and our Crowne Plaza experience was nice.

Singapore,"✅ Verified Review | I doubt that if Singapore Changi Airport deserves to be named as World's best airport after my recent experience at this airport. The extra security check near the gate after disembarkation was totally unnecessary, as all transit passengers will undergo another security check at the departure gate, so the whole process was just a waste of time. The fact that only my flight was being checked was surprising and I cannot understand the purpose of this excessive security check. Yet they put much less efforts on immigration clearance of passengers arriving at Changi. There were about 10 counters opened for that, and only about 7 or 8 people were in front of me when I started queuing to get through the immigration counters. However, it took me more than half an hour in the end because of the extremely low efficient passport checking process. However, what was more disappointing was that, after we have got through immigration clearance, we still had to wait for our last piece of the luggage to appear on the belt, despite the fact that by the time we got there, it was already 1 hour after we left the aircraft. Moreover, when I left Singapore via Changi Airport, the Wi-Fi didn't work at all. My phone could never reach the Internet to type in the password for free Wi-Fi for reasons that I didn't even know. I have attempted every method I could think of before giving up.

Singapore,❎ Unverified |  There was a time when Changi used to boast that immigration can be cleared and baggage collected in 5 minutes. I have visited Singapore many times for business and leisure. Sometimes I spend just a few hours in Singapore on a connecting flight to another country on business or catching up with friends. That is no longer possible with long immigration delays. I arrived in Singapore on a SilkAir flight from Colombo. First time on SilkAir. Surprisingly a Singapore owned airline did not have Singapore landing cards. After filling the form at the airport I joined the queue. It was a long long wait. A passenger from the same flight who was in front waiting to visit the city gave up and left the queue. When I finally arrived at the baggage conveyor area they have changed the flight number to a new flight. I finally arrived at my hotel exhausted and wondering whatever happened to Lee's Singapore. You need more immigration counters for foreign visitors. For about 10 to 20 Singaporeans there are about 6 or 7 counters which appear to be a waste. Delay may be due to greater security concerns. I hope the airport will address this problem soon.,8,Arrival Only,July 2017,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,5,N/A,5,0,N/A,N/A,4

Customs and immigration hassle free as long as you don't break the laws of the land.,10,Departure Only,May 2017,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Singapore Changi has been one of the best airport in the world in recent years and there is no doubt about it. Design wise, Changi has some really cool architecture design. Displaying mini gardens with orchids, trees, and other plants. For arrival, we get down the plane and got directly to the terminal building and there is a security check (which is weird). After that you can chose to use the moving walkway or use a train (which is very useful for gates like A16-A21). After that, you will be greeted with a very big immigration hall and a very nice decor with plants and statues. For departure, is the same story. Very nice design. Once you step inside, there will be a lot of check-in counters and the main lobby has a very tall ceiling featuring a glass roof (sunlight comes in). Then going inside, there will be ground crew checking your boarding pass and you will be directed to the immigration in front of that. After immigration, there will be shops, seats, and lounges everywhere. For those who gets the further gates, you can take the moving walkway or train (same as arrival). Once you get to the get, there will be the last security check and then you can wait for the plane. Changi Airport is a very comfortable airport to be in. Walking to the furthest gate wasn't a big pain. Terminal 3 also offers a lot of food choices (Kopitiam in B2 is my favourite). Everything is just very nice, a perfect blend of good design and passenger comfort.",10,Arrival and Departure,May 2017,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,4,4
Singapore,✅ Verified Review |  I have recently noticed a significant increase in the immigration queuing time both for arrivals and departures from Singapore Changi at all terminals. Queues of 25 to 30 minutes or longer are now common. Travellers need to factor these delays into their travel plans.,3,Departure Only,May 2017,Business,Departure Only,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Singapore Changi is always my favourite airport, not only comfortable and also beautiful. The toilets are always clean and it almost feels like it is brand new.

Singapore,"✅ Verified Review |  Went on a weekend trip with Thai Airways to Bangkok, with a disappointing experience at Changi Airport. The check in row was not that long, but the waiting time was way more than what I expected, because only two counters were open despite there are so many passengers queuing behind. Due to the aircraft change, my prebooked seat was gone, and I was randomly assigned in the end. This one I understand because nobody can predict the aircraft change. However, I was extremely disappointed that the check in staff looked very annoyed and reluctant to help when I asked where was my preselected seat and may I change seat. He just left me with two words ""No more!"" I'm really disappointed with this kind of attitude as it marked a bad start of my trip.",1,Departure Only,March 2017,Family Leisure,Departure Only,3,2,3,3,2,2,1
Singapore,"Singapore Changi is the best airport I had ever been. The service is very good and the cleanliness is amazing. This airport is convienient. There is a lot of F&B options. Easily reached our destination by the transportation MRT, bus , taxi. The queues are fast even immigration. There is skytrain to travel between the terminals. The best airport in the world in my opinion.",10,Arrival and Departure,November 2016,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"✅ Verified Review | I'm Chinese and studying in Singapore. Recently when I flew back to Singapore Changi from China, I did not expect there was arrival security after we disembarked from the plane, I was disappointed that there were only two lanes for passengers and this was from more than one flight. The arrival immigration queue was also very long, it took me nearly 45 minutes to get to the baggage claim, and the baggage was delayed as well. The immigration officer was not friendly.",2,Arrival Only,March 2017,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,3,3,4,3,3,3,1
Singapore,✅ Verified Review |  Whilst Changi remains an excellent airport to travel through our experience on arrival and departure this time wasn't so favourable. The queues at immigration on arrival were very long and they seemed to move very slowly which hasn't been the case before. Once through the baggage was delivered promptly and the usual well organised taxi queue moved quickly so we were on our way. At departure the immigration queues were long and also moved very slowly. This is clearly an area where the authorities need to investigate for improvement.,7,Arrival and Departure,March 2017,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,5,0,4,N/A,4
Singapore,"✅ Verified Review |  Changi Airport is the type of airport that you would want to check-in early. It offers facilities that caters to every travelers needs, from shopping, food, rest, and even plane spotting. It is easily navigable, all information is multilingual thus making it traveler friendly. Airport staff are friendly and are willing to assist you. Immigration and Customs clearance is efficient and fast.",10,Arrival and Departure,March 2017,Business,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Thanks to One World's new policy of not checking bags through if your connecting flight is on a different PNR, we had to collect our bags in SIN after arriving on Qatar, and check in afresh for Malaysia airlines flight to KL. I thought 2 hours between flights would be plentiful but we actually only made the connection by the skin of our teeth. The problem was the very slow immigration lines and that they pulled my partner for ""extra random checks"" which added a further 45 minutes. Hugely frustrating. Then it was a long walk from terminal 3 to terminal 1, and the MH flight left from the furthest gate. I normally think Changi is great but this time it was very stressful.",2,Transit,February 2017,Couple Leisure,Transit,5,N/A,2,0,5,N/A,1
Singapore,"✅ Verified Review |  Great airport. Lots of places to eat and drink, good variety of shops although a lot of these are designer so still expensive. Information staff extremely helpful. Early check in and queues smaller than anticipated. There is no baggage wrapping service in terminal 3 or 2 which means going to terminal 1 and then catching the shuttle back.",9,Arrival and Departure,January 2017,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,4,5,4,4,5
Singapore,Changi Singapore airport is very efficient and enjoyable. There were plenty of shops to choose from and immigration timing was a breeze. There was plenty of terminal seating to spare and the staff were pleasant and when I entered the bathroom it looked like it a hotel bathroom. Service quality is consistent.,10,Arrival Only,January 2017,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Upon arrival at Singapore Changi at belt 32 an initial batch of luggage came out. However, for up to 15 minutes after, the conveyor belt was empty - on top of the delay of the flight. Is it because it is a low-cost airline that less ground staff is assigned to offload the luggage? Very disappointed for Singapore standards.",4,Arrival Only,December 2016,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,3,N/A,3,0,N/A,2,2
Singapore,"The airport may not have the most spectacular architecture, but it excels at the functions people expect in an airport - immigration and security takes less than 2 minutes each, baggage arrives on the belt in 20 minutes, there's ample seating, and the toilets are clean, each with their own dedicated staff member. Small touches like kids games, mini gardens, carpeting or art installations create a pleasant environment. Changi Airport is one of the few airports in the world where I would dare to arrive just an hour before an international flight and still expect to make it to my gate with ample time to spare.",10,Arrival and Departure,December 2016,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,0,N/A,N/A,4
Singapore,"✅ Verified Review |  The airport is so efficient. The moment you are out of the aircraft, a short walk and its out to immigration. The airport has a very nice soothing ambience with well-placed signs and airport service staff directing connecting passengers to their next flight. There is staff on stand-by to look out for passengers who need any form of assistance. There wasn't any queue at immigration because it was so efficient. The baggage was out in good time too, I didn't have to wait long. There were trolleys aplenty and they were all parked beside the conveyor belt for easy retrieval. The taxi queue was long but the waiting time was extremely short because passengers are whisked out in a taxi so quickly! A very clean, green and efficient airport.",10,Arrival Only,December 2016,Couple Leisure,Arrival Only,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,Emirates lounge was closed during the busiest period of the year. Massive fail for Emirates and Changi to have this happen. Food quality is only fast food junk. No nice bistro cafes or wine bars so without a proper lounge there is no way to have a nice experience here. Shopping is average. Decor is outdated with awful brown carpets everywhere in the airport. Unable to take mineral water to the plane massive disappointment. Awful airport with no nice quality facilities. No comparison to Dubai.,2,Departure Only,December 2016,Couple Leisure,Departure Only,4,3,2,1,1,4,2
Singapore,"Singapore Changi is the best airport I have seen. It is designed and laid out very well. Customer service is 5-star. One can get help in various languages. Restrooms are kept very clean at all times. Food court is the ultimate in the world. Both Malaysia and Singapore have very similar food and the menu is huge catering Indian, Chinese, Malay, Thai, Indonesian and fusion style. My flight arrived and I left the airport in 20 mins.",10,Departure Only,December 2016,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Singapore Changi Terminal 3 is the best airport terminal I've been to. Upon arriving from my flight from Jakarta on SQ959, the immigration pass was really fast compared to other airport in the world I've been on. The wifi was good if you have a phone number like me and free to search or watch anything. Baggage does arrive faster and efficient unlike T1 or T2. The pricing for buying items was pretty expensive, but there was a good choice of restaurants. Overall, I will continue to use T3.",10,Arrival Only,December 2016,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Maybe I arrived into Singapore Changi on a bad day, but I was really shocked or had too high expectations. It took me 1 hour to get to the immigration point because the whole flight coming from Amsterdam including crew (so between 3-400 people) had to be squeezed through 2 doors and be checked upon arrival - even the crew was complaining. This alone took more than 30 minutes. Obviously there was a subsequent queue at the toilets and it took quite long to get to the baggage claim. A queue at immigration (1h after arrival) led to another 10 minutes waiting time. I was texting my friend who was picking me up when I finally had network again and was told off for this by the immigration officer - there was a lack of information, instruction and organization from the side of the airport which led to quite a delay.",5,Arrival Only,May 2016,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,4,3,3,3,3,2,2
Singapore,"I arrived at Singapore Changi around 5.30 coming in from Amsterdam with SQ323. My transit time was at that moment around 5.5 hours. Enough time to experience the airport at which we were once before (back in 1981). The link between terminals 2 and 3 was good, within 10 minutes we were at terminal 3. Because I had not obtained a boarding pass for my next flight I was taken to a transfer-location, where at the desk a not so friendly young lady took my itinerary and printed out the new boarding pass without even looking at me. That was the only less pleasant moment at the airport. For the rest, friendly people at the shops, at the hotel where I took a shower, at the bars and restaurants and at the waiting areas before the connecting flight. The airport is a city on its own and I liked it a lot. The garden, the butterfly-garden, the areas with trees, plants etc all look very attractive and for my layover I had a wonderful time. On my way back I was lucky that flight SQ228 arrived at terminal 3 and my connecting flight to Amsterdam also departed from terminal 3. The signs are highly visible, you can find your way without problems.",9,Transit,October 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,4,4,4,4,4,4

Singapore,"I didn't mind arriving at Singapore Changi 3.5 hours before my flight as I had a great experience travelling through. The soothing jazz music in the departure lounge gave the feeling of a being in the lobby of a fancy hotel rather than an airport. The beautiful outdoor gardens were a good place to have one last blast of the city's heat (although it was a shame some people ignored the no smoking signs). There were plenty of great shops, a quick scan of my passport gave me 3 hours of free WIFI and when I got tired of sitting, I was delighted to find a row of loungers for a lie down. Staff are very friendly and helpful and work hard to reduce long queues. It's a privilege if you're on a long haul flight that stops here as you'll have a great layover. One bit of advice I would give people who have not been here before is to have plenty to drink before boarding - as security is conducted at the gate, water is not allowed on the plane.",9,Arrival and Departure,September 2016,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
Singapore,"Not until you have experienced other airports around the world do you realise what a joy to travel through Changi is. The arrival process is faultless with no queues for immigration and friendly officers and bags already coming off the belt when you get through. It took me 30 minutes from arriving to being in my hotel room. Departure is also an absolute pleasure too. Again friendly immigration officers, an abundance of every conceivable shopping you would need and a calm, serene atmosphere with plenty of seating and food/drink outlets. Even free wifi. If only Changi could be replicated throughout the world I'd be a happy traveller.",10,Arrival and Departure,September 2016,Business,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

Singapore,"Singapore Changi is a great airport, brilliant architecture and efficient service. The staff were very nice and helpful. I felt welcome and did not feel lost at all, unlike during my travels elsewhere. Immigration is smooth and very quick, and the airport is unbelievably clean. Everything about this airport is flawless and no matter how hard I think I can't seem to find anything bad to say. Indeed worthy of being called the best airport in the world. You won't find any airport or services as good as this here in the States. Highly recommend. Great country, great airport. Now I understand why some people even come to Singapore just for the airport. Don't get me wrong, the country itself is magnificent and incredibly fun as well.

Simply wonderful, this airport is by far the best airport that I've been to. Everything is in good working condition, plenty of areas to visit, butterfly gardens, fast food and duty free shopping available upon arrival at Changi. Koi farms to allow guests to take a look while waiting in the transit areas, great amenities, charging ports for handphone. Definitely the most efficient immigration, hassle-free when using the e-counters, done within minutes.

All her belongs except passport, including wallet which contains hundreds of Australian dollars, phone, keys were in the bag. We approached the service desk and they helped us to track down the taxi and got through to the driver. The driver found the bag and agreed to return back to the airpot. The staff managed to go outside of the controlled area and fetched the bag. The taxi driver only asked for $10 to cover the taxi fare. All done within half an hour.

Singapore,"Singapore Changi is truly a wonderful airport to transit in. Traveling on SQ, we were entitled to S$20 Changi Transit Programme vouchers which my wife and I used to partly pay for the transit hotel. The room is clean, well kept with surprisingly comfortable beddings, good hot and cold water pressure and all the amenities one would expect in a standard hotel. And this at an airport. Changi is well known for its cleanliness and orderliness as well as its wide array of shopping, dining and (free) entertainment venues that even if one isn't travelling as a premium (business or first) passenger or with airline status with lounge access, one will not feel like cattle. In fact, I prefer some of the airier areas in Changi than the cramped up and claustrophobic (and sometimes noisy) airline lounges. The inter terminal skytrain works with clockwork efficiency and the terminal doesn't feel crowded at any time of day despite Singapore being a major hub. Minimal queuing times at the final security stop at the gate and the staff were polite yet professional.",10,Transit,July 2016,Couple Leisure,Transit,5,5,5,5,5,5,4

The airport also has the 24 hour food and beverage services. There are lots of massage chairs around the airport. Finally, the one that I really love is the huge mall areas. The mall areas of the airport are amazing because they sell almost everything - the quality is good and the prices are quite affordable.

Singapore,"I've noticed that Changi now has more free internet terminals than before. For this alone I'd rate it higher than Hong Kong International (another excellent airport). Changi's public transportation options to the city center rate slightly better than Hong Kong's. Both are very good, but what tips the balance in Singapore's favor is that its MRT service terminates at Changi. The best Hong Kong can manage is its MTR Airport Express, which is more comfortable and faster than the MRT, but costs a premium to ride. For regular MTR service, one has to take a bus shuttle to nearby Tung Chung.",9,Arrival and Departure,May 2016,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,4,5,4,N/A,N/A,4

Terminal 3 was the most modern terminal there, and it was easy to find the gate. A lot of shops were available along the way (almost like a big mall) and the prices for fashion were as high as in any other taxfree shop in the world. The food was surprisingly cheap compared to other airports, and the quality was good.

Most of the eateries were closed and limited shop before immigration. Clearing immigration was quick. Many shops after passport control, but most were closed as well. Seats were okay, but not at the gate, very limited. Also, when heading to the gates (T2) the airport is very dark and looks very old (brown/red carpets) not a great feeling.

Shopping will is excellent. In T2, there is a kids area that features Xboxes and the latest games. Right next to it is the sunflower garden and a parents relaxation zone with a mini-movie theatre. Business Class lounges get overcrowded during peak periods - 15 airlines using the same lounge, and not accounting for the Frequent Flyers.

There were no sanitary issues, and immigration times were fast, even though there was a large crowd of passengers due to a tour group. For departure, the check-in ground staff were very friendly. Once past customs and immigration, there was still a fair bit of time to boarding. That wasn't a problem. There was hundreds of shops, plenty of lounges, a pay-per-use lounge, a butterfly garden and plenty more. If you were at a different terminal, that wasn't a problem because there was a Skytrain to every terminal and even to gates A16 to A21.

The airport is huge but with the Intra and inter-terminal Changi Airport Skytrain makes the airport seem so much more compact. In terms of facilities this airport caters to everyone. Each terminal has at least either a McDonalds or Burger King for regular fast-food lovers, a Subway, some Southeast Asian and Chinese style fast-food chains, higher end dining and pubs where you can enjoy an alcoholic beverage in transit. The duty free shops here are amongst the best worldwide in terms of choice of goods. Furthermore staff are very professional and approachable.

Singapore,"This must be one of the best airports in the world for how old it is. It seems that Singapore Changi has thought of everything. The best thing about it is the lounging areas (or sleeping areas) for weary travellers to rest their heads without having to fork out to access a lounge. You can pretty much do everything you need to do to get some rest, food, and freshen up if you were transitting like we did. We had to spend 5 hours while waiting for our next flight. The only thing it needs doing now is to bring it into the 21st century. The decor is a bit dated.

In terms of food, there are smaller restaurants serving local delicacies to larger scale fast food chains serving easy to go food. There are free movie theatre's located in T3 and T2, swimming pool in T1 and a butterfly garden in T3 - it all caters to different age groups.

Singapore,"Changi Airport is simply fantastic. Not only because of it's comfort but mainly the overall user experience. Despite it being large I generally find it takes 20 minutes from gate to taxi which is exceptional. I travel about 50x year and Changi has never disappointed. Arrival staff are ready to guide passengers, convenient shops are available, luggage is often ready when you come out of customs and there are attentive support staff - my pregnant wife was immediately assisted even without asking. Taxi organisation is also top notch in terms of efficiency even if waiting times may occur.",10,Departure Only,January 2016,Business,Departure Only,5,5,5,5,5,3,5
Singapore,"Changi airport in itself is an excellent place to depart from or transit through, having a comfortable main departure area or plenty of lounges to sit in if preferred. There is a cinema as well as shower facilities. Plenty of shops to spend your dollars before departure. One issue I have with the staff at the airport, and this is aimed at the immigration staff. You are the first people that travellers may have seen/met of your country and politeness costs nothing. If you do not like what you do, go find something else. For me they were bordering on rude. Other than these people on the whole the rest of the staff at the airport were friendly and welcoming, making the experience of Changi reasonably hassle free to travel through.",8,Arrival and Departure,January 2016,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,4,4,5,5,3,3

I was on a flight to DPS, Indonesia and the gate which I was supposed to go into, was blocked by security because a flight which just arrived was supposed to walk there, and the flight was due just 10 minute away.

The message displayed on the TV screen said that the bags were delayed due to the fault in the ground handlers equipment.

Singapore,"There were a variety of things that were positive about the airport in terms of cleanliness, information being clearly provided, smoothness of the process of checking in etc. However I required a wheelchair when I arrived and was advised that there were restrictions on entering with certain wheelchairs at a certain time. It was only because we asked them to consider other options that we finally were able to secure a wheelchair rather than being forced to remain in one area for 1.5 hours despite having booking problems previously with another airline. When the wheelchair arrived, it had a cog system for braking which meant I was almost catapulted out of my seat and the seat itself was very unforgiving on my legs so I began my flight with additional pain as a result of this. I therefore hope that the airport secures new much more comfortable wheelchairs to allow passengers more comfort before beginning their flight.

The overall design and layout is logical and efficient with everything in English. The staff are likewise helpful and those working in Immigration and Customs are very fast and efficient at moving people through quickly but thoroughly. Yes taxi services can have long queues if you arrive at the wrong time, but otherwise if you are using a car service, Uber or other means of transport, the airport is played out to allow for passengers to be quickly picked up so that traffic at the airport is minimal.

Very friendly staff and stunning architecture too. Plenty to keep the kids occupied as well.

Singapore,Arrived at 1am. The taxi queue was unbearably long. Needed to queue for one hour plus. Got a taxi at 2.20 am!

Singapore,"The airport service and amenities were brilliant, but the airport staff were remarkable. Before my flight there was a jam at the PIE expressway which meant that me and my family members were already late for our flight. At the check-in counter the staff told us not to worry and called a collegue to guide us towards the boarding gate without further delay. My child was crying and immediately the staff gave my child a sweet and told him not to cry. When we reach the boarding gate she told the gate staff why we were late and told the cabin staff to take proper care of us.

Singapore,"I'm always amazed with the efficiency of this airport. Passport checks are super fast. Often there's no queue. The automated lanes are even faster. A nice touch is that you can rate the officer once you've walked through on a touch screen panel. Toilets are widely available and are very clean. And again you have an option to rate the toilets. Free massage chairs everywhere.There are not many smoking areas but besides the indoor smelly ones, they also have outdoor smoking area. As long as you arrive at the correct terminal, walking time to gates is in most cases under 15 minutes. Train between terminals is quick. If bringing things in that may require paying tax, you'll find they have very easy to use ""tax paying terminals"" available where you can use credit cards. The whole process takes less then 3 minutes. I'm most amazed by their luggage handling. I often find my luggage is on the belt before I can even reach it. Lounges are good as well, with the exception of Sky view lounge. Food is good and service is great. One remarkable experience is that once I hurt my ankle at the airport. Within 2 minutes of limping towards my gate, a trolley stopped and a very nice elderly airport staff member offered to drive me to the gate. When I tried to tip him he refused to accept it. One of the few issues I have identified is that it is not easy to find a place to take your picture that you may require for Visa on arrival in other countries. It happened once to me and I had to rush to another terminal and back. Shops are not cheap, besides cigarettes and liquor. A minor issue is the taxi lane. After going from gate to taxi queue within 15 to 20 minutes, it is odd you find yourself waiting for another 15 minutes for a taxi. But compared to other airports, it's still very fast.",9,Arrival and Departure,November 2015,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,0,N/A,N/A,5

Singapore,"Flew out of Changi Airport on the 25th June for my flight to Hong Kong. The check in agent was friendly and the airport police stationed at the entrance of the departure hall was friendly too, it made me feel really welcomed. Being an aviation enthusiast, I decided to do some plane spotting airside. I headed down to Terminal 3, hoping to photograph a Qatar Airways A350. I set up my tripod, and start taking a few shots of it. A tourist was intrigued by my camera and tripod, hence we both started chatting. As the tourist left for his flight, a fellow police officer, I saw who was watching me the whole time, walked up to me and told me off that I could not spot there. He warned me rudely that my camera could be confiscated and I could be jailed. I asked him the reason why, and he told me he was not sure but still insisted I leave that place immediately. That ruined my mood in the departure hall. I headed back to Terminal 1 as there was not much at Terminal 3. Since Changi does not offer plane spotters like me to openly go into gates and spot planes, I decided to take photos of the screens at each gate. In the process, several gate officers rudely shouted at me not to take the contents inside the gate and I felt terrified each time they do. I gave up on plane spotting in the airside, sitting near my departure gate waiting for my gate to open. Being a passenger and a Singaporean departing out of my home airport, I was extremely disappointed with the service of the Airport police. Instead, I felt they could have done better by not being so harsh. Despite all that, I still believe that Changi Airport is a brilliant airport, with excellent wifi service and signs helping passengers to get to their gate smoothly.",6,Departure Only,June 2015,Family Leisure,Departure Only,5,4,N/A,5,4,5,N/A

However, the departure experience was the worst I have had at any airport in years (including traditionally terrible airports like Nino Aquino or Don Muang). Lines were terrible at check in counters so I did web check in on my phone. Was told by security I needed to have printed boarding pass without any explanation as to why no such requirement was listed anywhere. The line for ""web check in"" seemed to simply be another check in line, which was moving slower than the normal check in line. When I asked for clarification from the manager the only explanations he could offer was 1? it was a budget airline so I was getting budget service and 2? they had over 200 flights to manage so I suppose I should just be patient. The delay was bad enough but the responses from SATS reps made it far worse.

Singapore,"Arrived and departed at both T3 and T2 at different times, T3 arrival mid afternoon was seamless. Small queue at immigration, bags waiting on the belt. No waiting for a taxi. For the first time in many years however there was a customs inspection via xray. But thru in less than a minute. Some pax were being searched. T3 early morning departure involved a short wait in a SQ check in queue but straight thru emigration. Excellent but quite expensive food choices, free and fast wifi, very clean rest rooms, plenty of flight info boards, travelators to the more distant gates, no hassles at gate security, comfortable seating in gate lounges. boarding well organized. T2 late afternoon departure fine as well with no hold up checking in or at emigration. Less food choices than T3 and terminal is showing its age a little. But it is still clean and spacious. gate security and gate lounges fine. free wifi. T2 mid afternoon arrival involved a full on security check in the concourse. It was a little chaotic. Instructions prior to putting hand luggage on the belt and pax walking thru the scanner were contradicted by the personnel on the 'other side' which involved many pax having to go back and repeat the process. If they are going to do this they need to get their act together. Ipads are not lap tops! Again no queue at immigration and a short wait for bags. Taxis were scarce for about 5 minutes but the backlog soon cleared.

Singapore,In a nutshell - Singapore is smart point A to point B everything works. Well maintained by experienced seniors. Changi is just the easiest airport to navigate whichever method you choose to get around. Fast City to airport transfers via train for less than $5 direct to your terminal these include designated carriages designed minus some seats to cater for bags Ac signage in English clear and concise. Complementary massage chairs throughout the terminals as if there was ever any stress here outdoor smoking lounges makes sense to me fast travelators sky trains between terminals heavens above orderly fast clean modern Taxis at your call butterfly sky gardens. Airports world wide take note - designated snooze lounges are brilliant. Comp wifi easy access with a server to handle the traffic for-nominal. I also enjoyed a variety of hawker food stands located at T2 not cheap but there seemed to be some degree of managed hygiene resulting in an enjoyable meal.

Singapore,From all the airports I have seen in my past Changi Airport is the best.

Singapore,This airport is simply the best in the world. Terminal 3 is particularly nice as it is basically a mall with planes but even the older Terminals 1 and 2 are quite lovely. Perhaps the best aspect concerning Changi is that they always seem to be improving. Most Asian airports are a fair bit better than the average US airport but Singapore goes above and beyond. It is right up there with Seoul Bangkok and KL in terms of modernity and quality. I usually fly Delta which uses T1 but I always look forward to those opportunities to fly with Singapore Airlines which uses T3. The plethora of eating options and shops in all three terminals are impressive. While the aesthetic experience at SIN is top-notch the logistics are also good. The walk from the gate to Immigration is generally not too bad. The Immigration area itself is spacious and easy to use. The processing is very quick with the signature efficiency of the Singaporean system the key to the smooth functioning. I have never had to wait long to get through this process. The baggage area is just downstairs from Immigration and again I have never had to wait long for my bags to arrive. I have also had to get carnet documents stamped several times in the Customs area and found this to be efficient as well. When emerging from the secure zone there are ATMs that accept international cards though they are not particularly obvious at first. The taxi area can get rather bogged down at times. In T1 be aware that there are two taxi queues. On my most recent visit one taxi queue was quite busy while the other was wide open. If you find one line rather long try the other as it probably saved ten or fifteen minutes in my case. Taxi fees are very reasonable. I went to Boat Quay and the fare with tip was about $35 SGD or about $26 USD. I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza before and it is a very nice option connected to T3. Being able to walk to the terminal is a big plus. For those who are transiting through there is a rail system between terminals that functions well for those who are using this airport for connections. On departure the processing for both check-in and immigration is fast from my experience. The security areas are all individually situated at the gates. Be aware that there are no services inside many if not all of the gates so don't go through too early. The security is efficient so there is no need to rush through. The boarding process is generally easy and stress free. My major complaint about this airport might have more to do with Delta Airlines than the facility itself. On my recent flight there was no lounge available except for Business Class in spite of the fact that I am a Delta Sky Lounge member. Overall this is one of the best airports in the world. It is actually a pleasure to have a little time here as there are so many things to do making the wait as easy as it could possibly be. The logistics are some of the best in the world and Immigration and Customs are some of the few that function well. If you have an option to use this airport it is a great choice.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A

Singapore,This airport was confusing as it displayed the best and worst of what an airport can be all in one! Arrived Terminal 2 toilets clean but mostly squat toilets! There was 1 western toilet in each block which was always full as no-one wanted to use the squat toilets I found this problem throughout the airport which was very surprising as I've traveled extensively in Asia and never seen this at an airport before. Passport control took over an hour by which time the baggage was left on carousel but no airline sign was on there so we had to ask. Airport looks great very impressive until we noticed the lack of basic seating. Most restaurants closed about 10pm so it was too late for us. They had 24 hour food courts which were great only problem is they didn't accept card. The cash machines nearby would only let us draw out 100SGD so didn't want to be left with all that money for a cheap meal. The airport lacked signposts and was hard to navigate we walked around to different terminals and others were having the same problem. They had wifi but it was different in each area so you had to request a code and find the information desk each time! Very inconvenient as sms codes didn't work. Had lots of problems speaking to staff in English which was surprising for a country where its the official language. I was very disappointed in this airport its like they are in a race to build more gimmicky things and are too concerned by the look of the airport to overlook basic things like restaurants accepting credit cards lack of seating and toilets fast passport control! It is a very impressive airport on the surface but basic airport things are just lacking!,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Singapore,Tired of having long immigration queues? Tired after a long flight? Want to have a shower movies and a garden to satisfy your cravings and relax while you wait for your plane? Well then Changi is just for you. Immigration queue in 5 mins lots of places to relax and enjoy bags on the carousel the moment you clear immigration. Fast efficient and quite a charming airport. Transport to the city though was the only thing Changi is lacking have to transfer if you take the metro and no 24 hr transportation except the taxis which were expensive. However Changi is a masterpiece that caters for the needs of its passengers and strives to provide excellent and professional service.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Singapore,Changi is a delight for departing arriving and transiting passengers. VAT refund is computerized and terribly easy. The queue time for immigration is barely 2-3 minutes and the luggage is on the belt once you complete immigration. Extremely efficient taxi queues. Many options to eat relax and shop at both T2 and T3 which are connected by a Skytrain. For passengers in transit Changi provides vouchers that can buy you food or cater to shopping needs or even a snooze in the lounge. Free wifi is great. Very clean washrooms and great service!,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Singapore,The best airport in the world. At least for transiting passengers. Having inexpensive showers real Singapore $ vouchers was a great delight. Everywhere service was fine. Very good restaurants. Most interesting shops. Not having to walk too much made journey so easy. Also good was the clarity of signs.

Singapore,Arrived into Changi airport Terminal 1 on 28/7/2014 at around 3.35pm. Immigration queues were long and took nearly 1hr to get through. There were plenty of counters available but no officers put on. The worst part of the whole experience is waiting for taxis after clearing customs and having to wait for over 100 mins to get to the cab. The queues snaked back to the Arrival gates and it was chaos in the main lobby. There was a girl representing Changi Airport to tell people where to queue for taxi but no explanations or assistance offered to anyone.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Singapore,Consistency re queues has dropped recently for Immigration. I waited 50 minutes on a quiet Tuesday afternoon in T3. A colleague in T1 took 90 minutes later that evening but another colleague took 25 seconds the day before. In my case no explanations were given no apologies were made and no water was offered. With the air-con broken that day throughout all terminals it was a very long wait in sticky hot humid conditions. While the airport infrastructure itself remains generally excellent (clean shopping pool flower displays seating free Wi-Fi) I think Changi no longer has enough Immigration staff rostered on - not something expected in the World's Best Airport.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Singapore,There is a reason this airport surpasses the rest. From the time you walk in the airport it environment is different from the typical airport facility. It has the comforting climate of a hotel while having all the stores of a mall. But not that is not all. Did I mention they have movie theatre gym game stations too? These are non- essential additions but that people can really appreciate. Passengers can be very tired and might have a few hours of layover. When an airport offers these kind of amenities it can make all the difference in the experience. Needless to say Changi airport also got the basic system nailed. Baggage claim immigration clearance and other similar processes that make one's experience miserable are minimized in this airport thanks to their well-executed and efficient system.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Singapore,Best airport I've been to. Clean waiting times no problems due to many shops amusement bars massage/fitness a very nice garden to walk in. Prices for food are ok. No waiting times for taxi.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified |   Hong Kong Airport has not lost its lustre, beauty, elegance, cleanliness. And its employees are highly professional, respectful, and friendly. Every time I travel through it, I discover something new, and this time I discovered the following: A breathtaking and Epic view from the Sky Deck. In late 2022, Hong Kong International Airport opened its new Sky Bridge – a 200-metre-long bridge built 28 metres above the ground. This is the world’s longest bridge over an active runway, allowing even an Airbus A380 to pass underneath. This bridge allows passengers and aviation lovers to enjoy breathtaking panoramic views of the airport’s aircraft movement and watch aircraft take off, land, and pass beneath them, an experience unparalleled at any other airport.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified |   I highly appreciated how clean the airport was, and gave points to its clear signs and directions, as well as fast WiFi and F&B services. Immigration (both Arrival and Departure), however, was a disaster and a big shame to the airport management team! At the Arrival, a very long line of tired passengers was patiently waiting for the slow staff to complete their inefficient processes. Took me an hour to go through the immigration. The staff who handled my documents was super slow, kept checking and asking even though I showed him everything (flight ticket, hotel reservation, tour reservation), and even told him it was not my first time to Hong Kong. He even checked the other visas and stamps in my passport slowly, one by one! Same as the Departure, those who could not use the e-channel had to queue and wait hopelessly. Staff suddenly stopped checking passport, he walked out of his cabin for 10 minutes and then came back, and we needed to wait! Not deserved a 5-star airport quality at all.",4,Arrival and Departure,December 2024,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,4,5,4,4,3,1

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I do not understand how people claim this is a top tier airport. I found the staff to be very rude and abrupt with voyagers, on arrival immigration officer was nice to me but I saw them being very nasty towards certain nationalities. The lavatories are filthy and no staff near to be found. The signals on the old part of the airport are actually better than the ones on the new terminal which can be confusing to say the least. Prices are the same as in town, but I found the airport express to be a little bit expensive considering the distance. Check in staff seem not to know what they are doing and have to be calling their supervisor constantly, it leads to huge and slow lines.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I can definitely feel the hustle and bustle vibe as I step into the airport. It looks like the airport is returning back to what it was before the pandemic. People were dragging their suitcases and rushing to the check in counters in all directions. The waiting line at the check in counter was definitely longer than I last traveled back in 2020, but frankly acceptable because the flight was quite full. Despite my boarding gate was at the Terminal 1, I spent a little bit of time visiting the newly opened sky bridge, which is located between Terminal 1 and its satellite terminal. It is quite amazing to witness aircrafts taxiing beneath the sky bridge.",7,Arrival and Departure,February 2023,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4,4,5,5,4,5,4
Hong Kong,✅ Trip Verified | World class airport! I'm touched to see the airport is packed of travelers and tourists. Waiting time takes a bit longer than pandemic because of insufficient ground service staff accommodating the unexpectedly amount of tourists. I hope the airport authority can hire more staffs ASAP. I'm also happy to see there's new restaurants. Had a chance to try the Taiwanese food and it was great. Security is quick and air train comes very frequently. Great experience.,9,Departure Only,February 2023,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,5,4,5,5,4,5,5

Thanks to the Emirates' poor ground service, I had to wait quite a long time to check in my baggage because there was some issues going on.  There were several dining options at the check in area but more restaurants inside the departure area.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Since there is no PCR procedure, the whole process from checking in baggage to the boarding gate was smooth. The e-security gates and e-boarding gates were quick, but I'm also concerned about collecting personal information since taking facial photos will be required during the process. Some stores and restaurants are open at the airport, but not all of it. I guess more and more stores and restaurants will reopen as traveling becomes normal. Other than that, everything is just about the same like before. Keep that up.",9,Departure Only,February 2023,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,5,5,5,4,4,5,4

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely atrocious transit experience. I flew in from MNL allowing myself two hours to transit to my onward flight to LHR. Firstly, the transit unnecessarily requires travellers to to use eGates to verify passport and boarding cards which merely repeats the action taken out at the boarding gate and is not my experience of other airports There are only five eGates and only one member of staff to assist with eGate issues, which inevitably seem to occur with about half of the users. This created a massive bottleneck. Once through the eGate, you then have to join another queue, stretching right back to the eGates, for security screening of luggage. No-one was managing this queue and it was so long that I was seriously in jeopardy of missing my connecting flight and, unlike other airports, there was no member of staff to prioritise PAX in this situation. I really expected better from Hong Kong airport and will in future try to avoid transit there.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Arriving at Hong Kong International Airport is an extremely unpleasant experience, and the review fits the airport as the government is the owner of the airport, and implements the draconian arrival requirements. There is more staff in blue suits than passengers themselves, it feels like you are arriving at an internment camp, and your crime is that you traveled into Hong Kong. I cannot with enough strong words warn against even transit through this airport, imagine a department of health officer demanding to do a covid test on you or a stool test on your toddler. And then telling you that your toddler is covid positive despite all scientific evidence, then they separate you from your child, and put you into a 14-day close contact quarantine at a government camp without your baby. This is all possible through the powers handed to the officials at the airport by the CAP599 from the Hong Kong Government.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Beautiful, modern airport with great views of the commanding mountains which feel like they immediately abut the property. Easy access via either motorway, bus, or ferry (via bus) to either Macau or China, as well as the amazing efficient Airport Express train to Kowloon, the harbour, and Wanchai. The selection of shopping isn't nearly as good as Singapore Changi, but still very good by international standards. Airport clean for the most part, though there are some gates where seating could stand to be a little ampler. You can even pay for snacks and drinks using your HK transit card, which I did upon departing from HK! Baggage pickup is efficient, and baggage check-in wasn't too onerous for a budget airline upon departing. Customer service from airline personnel, to the ticket agent who directed me to the Airport Express train, to coffee shop baristas, was courteous and helpful. However, customs and immigration are the least friendly I've ever interacted with in Asia, though they are efficient, and they are not actively hostile like you might expect to find in North America. In all, there's definitely a feeling of taking a step down when flying into Hong Kong from the truly amazing Singapore Changi and even Seoul Incheon, but HK is still heaps above and beyond pretty much any major North American hub. I mean, HK really is still nothing to be ashamed of, and it's amazing the geographic constraints that had to be overcome to build this airport back in the 1990s.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I was somewhat apprehensive transiting through Hong Kong given the news of civil unrest in that city. My fears were unfounded. On the contrary, I found the terminal to be much less crowded than in the past. I spent a little over three hours in the terminal and visited the Bridge lounge where I took a shower and shaved. Clean bathroom though the lighting is very dim. Given that the color palette of the bathroom was dark, it was a challenge to differentiate between the bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel! There are many food choices, both cooked and self service, in the lounge. The free wi-fi worked well. Helpful lounge staff. A silent airport with no announcements except for flight delays - need to keep an eye on the flight display monitors. Sometimes gates are not assigned until closer to departure times. This is a sprawling airport requiring quite a bit of hoofing and my connecting terminal had to be reached by a bus service. Hence, a lot of time to reach your connecting gate. The security check on arriving was smooth and not intrusive. The usual international brand shops are there. I was able to do some last minute shopping for gifts without feeling a rush of shoppers in the stores. The terminal is clean, properly signed, and well-lit. I recommend this airport for transiting on Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon flights.",8,Transit,September 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,5,5,5,4,4,4
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Being a clumsy traveller, I left my phone somewhere in the airport when I got off the plane. I initially thought I had left the phone in the plane. As soon as I realised I had lost my phone, I asked the flight attendants from my CX 704 BKK-HK flight to help and they kindly guided me to a booth at the baggage claim area. The gentleman at the booth immediately followed up by going to the plane that I took and searched every aisle in order to find my phone. While I was waiting, his colleague frequently updated me about the search process. I feel bad for making them go through so much as I didn't realise at that instance that my phone was actually in the airport and not in the plane. When I was finally able to track the location of my phone, I got in touch with lost and found via email and phone and they started working on my case immediately and found my phone within 3 hours. I am so grateful to all of the staff (Cathay Pacific flight attendant, baggage claim staff, lost & found staff) for helping me find my phone.",10,Arrival Only,September 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,5,N/A,5,0,N/A,5,5
Hong Kong,✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong airport is very convenient for transit passengers. The signs are clearly marked along the way. Many restaurants open till midnight so it's friendly for overnight transferring passengers.,8,Transit,August 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,3,3,5,4,4,5,2
Hong Kong,"Not Verified |  This was a bad experience for me. I left Hong Kong on 17th August. I know the situation in Hong Kong but I can't believe that the staff service was terrible. When I got off the bus at terminal 1, there were over thousands of tourists queueing to enter the airport because of the low-efficiency airport staff. They needed to check your boarding pass and passport to allow you to enter the terminal. I waited nearly an hour, the efficiency is really terrible. Afterwards, I was looking for a dining zone but there were not many restaurants. This was a bad experience at Hong Kong Airport. I do not recommend this airport. If you want to dine or go shopping, it's better to go to other places than the airport.",1,Departure Only,August 2019,Business,Departure Only,2,1,2,1,1,1,1

Hong Kong,"❎ Not Verified | As many do, I worked all day without a meal. Planned to get to the airport a bit early to have a bite and relax. Found there are only three sit down restaurants that are not under renovation and the ones that are open have a huge queue. What idiot thought it was a good idea to renovate 50% of the restaurants at the same time? I come here often and the restaurants have been under renovation for at least 6 months. This is a really big busy airport and there isn't nearly the number of restaurants to feed passengers. Someone really really stupid is making decisions here. You would never see this at other premium airports in the region.",3,Arrival and Departure,August 2019,Business,Arrival and Departure,4,3,2,1,N/A,4,1
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong is a large airport but is well organized, it’s easy to change gates for connecting flights. Very crowded of course, but it is quite understandable in such a busy place.

I chose Hong Kong as my transit over Bangkok this time, expecting a different and more beautiful service, but I was totally wrong... The information desk was empty too, nobody to was there to help. Few security staff were there but they could not get you the exact help. Overall it was the worst experience I have had in my years of travel.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong Airport is actually my favourite airport, although for others I know it's not the best. I like the large windows which are great for looking at planes, plenty of seats and dining options, and very cheap duty free/shopping in general, aided by the fact that the Hong Kong dollar has depreciated a lot! I would say that the location of the duty free shops could be improved, as there is only one electronics store which is not so convenient for transit passengers to see. Arrival into Hong Kong airport is quite a fast experience. After a lengthy walk from your gate, immigration is very speedy and our bags were already on the belt by the time we got out. On our way back, we took the ferry from Guangzhou to Hong Kong airport. This ferry is extremely convenient as you only have to clear Chinese customs and not Hong Kong customs as well. Saves a lot of hassle. Some gates are a bit badly signposted. We were at gate 36 which is at the very end of the long centre concourse, only a very short walk away from the other shuttle train stop. I had to walk very quickly to my gate as it was almost boarding time. There are a good choice of lounges from all alliances here, but the plaza premium (Priority pass) lounges have extremely long lines outside! In conclusion, Hong Kong airport has its faults, but I'm still overwhelmed by this airport. Even though it's 20 years old if you told anyone who has never been there they probably might as well have thought it was built yesterday! The most important thing: This airport's wifi is very fast and easy to connect!",10,Arrival and Departure,April 2019,Business,Arrival and Departure,4,5,4,5,5,5,4
Hong Kong,✅ Trip Verified | The airport is neat and clean but the airport staff are very rude! The staff threw the basket at me when she found out I forgot to remove my laptop from my bag and rudely told me to get it out. Another staff member also started pushing us and screaming to us in Cantonese because we were lost and we were figuring out where to fall in line. We can't understand what she was saying because we are foreigners.,1,Departure Only,June 2019,Family Leisure,Departure Only,4,N/A,2,0,N/A,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,✅ Trip Verified |  Has the potential to be the best airport I have ever passed through except for the fact that everything is closed after 11pm. I couldn't find a single restaurant open except for a Starbucks. My flight was at 1am so I ended up eating toast. Depressing. Facilities looks great for daytime travellers though.,6,Arrival and Departure,March 2019,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,1,2,5,5
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Too many smoking rooms. Smoke is leaking badly outside of the rooms. Should shut them down, or move them to a separate building, or to a remote corner.

Very relaxed feel, clean and speedy to travel theough, however be aware, if you are travelling in the early morning, except for Starbucks (which had a 20-25 minute queue at 5:40am), and a few other restaurants, absolutely nothing opens here before 7am! Which for a major international hub, is really poor. There is a McDonalds and a 7-Eleven landside, what use is that?

A lot of shops before and after customs, there's also a large variety of shops for food, daily items etc. Great transportation network to the city (Airport Express, buses, taxi and ferry). Connections with different concourses are convenient and with clear instructions. Online website and app MyFlight are really useful. Both have live information about the flight (with notifications). Mobile app also has signage translation in 9 languages and baggage arrival notice. Airport Wifi Service is very quick. Baggage claims are convenient and fast. Custom as well.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I have used Hong Kong airport few times. This time I was transit through (traveling CX business class). Perhaps it was my lucky day but there was no queue at the security screen. Having said that after I finished my security check the queue started to build up so I assume the transit process is ""efficient"" for first/business class passengers but not to economy. From touch down to be in the CX lounge shower it was only 15 minutes. The only thing lacking in Hong Kong airport is the friendliness of the staff. And unlike Singapore there is not much facilities. However full mark goes to the cleanliness and the design of the airport.",7,Transit,January 2019,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,4,5,4,3,4,3
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | 
I'm writing this review for my grandmother who was offered the wheelchair from the plane as she cannot walk long distances. We were waiting for 15 mins post arrival for a wheelchair. A lady with a concierge tag on her shirt checked her boarding pass and said she will get someone to assist us with a wheelchair as she was already assisting someone. A man came with a wheelchair and checked her boarding pass. He walked away saying someone will come back to assist us. I spoke to the flight stewardess informing her of the situation, she told me there was only 1 person assisting 3 wheelchair passengers and she has no way to contact anyone else to assist us. After another 15 mins she informed us that she had already called them. The wheelchair arrived finally after another 10 mins. As modern and accessible as the HK airport is why would they only have a few staff to assist all the elderly and people in need of assistance.",1,Arrival Only,December 2018,Family Leisure,Arrival Only,4,N/A,3,0,N/A,4,1
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I arrived on an Air Asia AK 136 at around 5:30 pm, wasn't too busy at he time, on Christmas day. The peak being 22nd to early hours of 25th. After pass immigration and waited at belt, there was a significant delay to the delivery of our luggage. (Our plane parked at 205 with aero bridge, not those remote bus gate). The luggage seemed to come in 2 lots, with a good half an hour in between. I was unlucky to be the 2nd lot, meaning I waited more than 45 minutes for my bag. I don't think it's the airline's fault. Hong Kong airport has lately suffered from slow luggage delivery, and it seems to be getting worse. I ended up leaving the airport at about 7pm, what a terrible experience! It's a shame , as other aspects of HK airport are some of the best in the world, they need to get serious to address this problem.",4,Arrival Only,December 2018,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,4,3,4,0,N/A,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I’m writing from exasperation at the long wait for a wheelchair for my mother, senior citizen, unsteady on her feet and requiring assistance. She arrived Hong Kong mid November and waited 40 minutes after aircraft doors opened. Apparently the crew members waited for her, as cleaners and caterers were servicing the aircraft. Today on her return flight, she was informed the wheelchair would arrive at 4.40 pm for a 6 pm departure, and finally arrived 5.20 pm, with a harried and impatient wheelchair assistant. This is unacceptable to pay a high airport tax and receive such poor service on both arrival and departure flights of the same trip. And the reason given by airline ground staff is that Hong Kong airport uses just one wheelchair company for all airlines and its short staffed, so the best they can do at anytime. Very disappointed with HK airport authorities for such poor quality and inefficient service!",3,Departure Only,December 2018,Family Leisure,Departure Only,4,2,4,3,3,3,2
Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I can honestly say Hong Kong airport is one of the nicest airports I've ever been through. To be fair, have I been in every major airport on earth? No, of course not, but I have traveled to many airports including LAX, ORD, EWR, LHR, CDG, HND, and so forth. For me HKG is easily one of the best in the world. The coolest thing in my view is the terminal is one huge open space. As in one huge roof that goes on, and not many different sections or terminals you commonly see at older airports. The engineering aspect alone is really fascinating. On top of that, the architecture and aesthetics are quite nice. It's mostly open, bright, and very pleasing to walk around. You very rarely felt claustrophobic in the airport, and the only crowded areas are check-in depending on time of day, and security. For example, the United check in counter wasn't crowded, but United only has 2-3 flights out a day compared to Cebu which is packed with several daily flights to Manila. Meanwhile security and immigration was smooth and quick overall, and it wasn't too crowded on my way in and out. The food and shopping options were quite nice. There were a lot of shops in the main mall before the gates, then another mini-mall with several shops around gate 60. You have many huge brands from Chanel to Calvin Klein if you fancy nice clothes, and the main duty free store was huge with very rare bottles of top notch whiskey and spirits. I bought some fresh tea and cookies on my way out. The only negative about shopping is I didn't find any cliche tourist store. I know it sounds cheesy, but I was hoping to find a mug or model Cathay Pacific plane. Meanwhile the food options are good with some notable fast food brands to local chains. The only negative is I didn't see many bars or food options in between gates, but they had the mini-mall and a food court halfway down the terminal. I can't complain too much, but it would be nice to have a couple options beyond a store when you're in the middle of the gates. Finally, the Wi-Fi was free, and worked well. The best part of the airport is the the train network to the airport is amazing. The high-speed rail is about $14 (USD) to Hong Kong station, and the train runs every 10 minutes. It was fast, and easy to get too when you pass through immigration. On top of that, there are plenty of ATMs to get cash, and they have counters and machines to get your local Octopus card. FYI, the Octopus card is their transport card which is a must-have in Hong Kong for the buses to subway. Finally, the signs are listed well, and it's easy to navigate around the airport. The only point it loses is it needs a bar or two in between gates. Overall this is a top notch airport that provides the necessities well, and gives you tons of shopping and dining options when you have some time to wonder around.",10,Departure Only,December 2018,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,5,5,5,4,5,5,5

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified |  Transited on my way to Calcutta from New York from Cathay Pacific to Cathay Dragon. This is a large, sprawling airport requiring long hikes. A central atrium has lots of shops selling both international brand products and also regional brands. I purchased some liquor and cosmetics - doing so was easy. I visited the business class lounge. It was excellent - quiet, clean, lot of places to sit and relax, vast range of food, many cooked to order, tidy bathrooms, ample reading materials, soft and hard drinks, cold and hot beverages, helpful staff, superb WiFi connection and lots of charging points. I am being finicky when I say that the multi-roomed lounge was rather dark with subdued lighting. That went for the bathrooms too where I had a refreshing shower - with clean towels and toiletries in place. The walk to my connecting flight was long and on reaching the gate, I had to take a bus to an island terminal to reach the actual boarding gate. Ample waiting space and seats at gate. The security check between arrival and departure was quick, orderly, quiet, and efficient. Signage was good and easy to follow.

Hong Kong,"Not Verified | Hong Kong International Airport is a massive complex featuring two terminals (1 and 2), and two separate concourses (North Satellite and Midfield). While the terminals and concourses are connected by a driverless train, getting around each terminal or concourse may still require significant walking, even despite level escalators. Wear comfy shoes! There are plenty of options for shopping, dining and entertainment throughout the airport, though Terminals 1 and 2 probably offer the most amenities, as they both include shopping malls. Free WiFi is available, and there are plenty of power outlets with which to charge your mobile devices; however, be advised that they only take Hong Kong/English plugs and USB.

Hong Kong,✅ Trip Verified | I went through HK Airport twice in two weeks around dinner time so after passing through immigration decided to visit the food court on both occasions.

It took 1 hour of zombie shuffling to reach the desk and get out only to find at 2.15 am all the hotel shuttles buses gone. How in hell's name can a major international airport like HK simply not provide sufficient resources to process the incoming flights? These long delays are a feat of endurance and bladder control.

Signs were large and easy to read, they were also clear in pointing out directions to go. Immigration was fast, efficient, my friend and I spent less than half an hour from gate to landside. In addition, after exiting the baggage reclaim area, transportation was also easy to find and plentiful-we took the Airport Express, a premium service provided by MTR to link the airport to the city area. This method was the fastest, taking less than half an hour to travel to the city area, and yet it had very good value for money as well. Once again, no problems finding ground transportation. On our departure leg, the experience was roughly the same - we took the Airport Express from the city centre straight into the Airport and immigration was smooth, no problems. The airport itself was also really clean, and we had no problems getting from one place to another within this airport. Overall, an excellent experience.",10,Arrival and Departure,December 2017,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,4,4,5
Hong Kong,"❎ Not Verified |  As an international airport it has got what it should have but the main problem is the price point. The price point of the food is much higher than the city, like 25% higher. However most of the discounts are unavailable in the airport neither non restricted area or restricted area. Another problem is that power plug is not enough in the seating area. If you want to charge your laptop or phone, you might want to bring your own power bank.

Hong Kong,"✅ Verified Review | Arriving in Hong Kong a few hours after HK was hit by a strong Typhoon (Signal no.10), I did not have high expectations. After landing, the plane wandered around the airport for 20 minutes before reaching a remote slot. Passengers had to wait for a connecting bus to get to the airport. A passenger somehow got hurt on the aircraft and refused to get off, which made everyone wait and stand for another 20 or so minutes on the crowded bus, a horrible experience. Finally reaching the arrival terminal, It was so much crowded than usual with a very long queue at the customs. Fortunately, as a HK citizen, I can utilise the E-channel and I passed the customs in around 6 minutes. Luggage was another 15 minutes wait, which was very lengthy added to the long wait on the connecting bus. But it was after typhoon, so somehow it was understandable. Everything was still organised, no fuss at all. Although being attacked by a strong typhoon, the lighting, the building itself were still intact. Nothing fell off and no water leakage can be seen.

Hong Kong,"✅ Verified Review |  
HKG is one of the best airports to transit or arrive at. It is well designed, well-lit and modern. The security checks are very smooth, and the personnel are very polite, well-trained and efficient. There is almost never long security lines, partly due to the large number of parallel screening belts, and partly due to the efficiency and speed of the staff. There are adequate charging and computer terminals around the gate areas and free high speed WiFi. Restaurant selections in the terminals are where this airport truly shines. Some of my favorite food places in HK are inside the airport! From Ramen to Italian food, the restaurants and food court stalls never fail to amaze. As far as shopping goes, there are a plethora of luxury retail stores, although I have never really ventured beyond the electronics and chocolate sections of the duty free. And if you get bored of the terminal HK is one of the few cities to allow a visa on arrival to most countries - and the airport express has good connectivity to the city. In the city transit is a breeze with the underground (MTR). All transit tickets and day-passes can be purchased at the airport itself.",10,Arrival and Departure,July 2017,Business,Arrival and Departure,5,5,5,5,4,4,4

Hong Kong,✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong International Airport is still commonly known as one of the best airports and Hong Kong people should be proud of having such an amazing airport. It is efficient and easily accessible. Yet the state of this Airport has started to deteriorate over the years. Facilities start to turn old and terminals start to look slightly worn out. Terminals are mostly clean but not spotless. Some toilets are in terrible conditions and not well maintained.

Fantastic and quick immigration, excellent transport links over and above the airport rail link (I used the bus to Tung Chung and the metro from there to the city as I had time to kill). Plenty of decent shops both landside and airside, unlimited wifi and plenty of places to eat.

Good points - many charging stations for your devices, plus Macs for accessing the internet (free), security screening. I had some metal items in my baggage of a personal nature (my grandfather's war medals), the staff in Hong Kong were the only ones to question these, however, they did this in a most sensitive manner. Food and beverages aren't the cheapest and are the usual main street options (McD's, Starbucks, etc) - how about an authentic hawker style food outlet? Had to have a shower - not cheap, HKG200 in a lounge.

This is no surprise, all within expectation for a multiple best airport awards winner. However, the time for luggage pick up seemed to be longer and longer these few years. In the past, the luggage arrived as soon as you reached the place for pick up. For this time, I have waited for more than 10 minutes. Of course I know 10 minutes wait is already considered as really good even in other large cities airport such as London Heathrow, Taipei Taoyuen airport and Manchester airport, but I do expect Hong Kong airport to do better as they used to be.

We were just connecting from LAX-HKG-KUL and had a 50 minute connection scheduled (sold to us as a legitimate connection). On the day, this ended up being a just over 20 minute connection. We moved swiftly through the airport, through security and boarded the KUL flight directly.

Baggage quick out on the belt and the airport is well connected via taxi, train, limo and bus. Departing, one can find check in counters aplenty and security queues are fast moving. Immigration outbound was slower than usual but still went airside pretty quickly.

Hong Kong,"✅ Verified Review |  The policy of this airport to perform an additional, manual search of carry-on baggage to confiscate bottled water, has become enough of an inconvenience for me to avoid it in future. If they deem such a search necessary, surely they can invest in mobile scanners, rather than unpack and disarrange each person's bag by hand. I have experienced several flight delays as a result. I have also have to wait for a prolonged period in the queue, plus stand and hastily repack my bag. Their arrogance has also been irritating. Yes, they use gloves, but that is for their own protection. It does nothing to the hygiene of passengers' personal effects. All hand baggage has already been scanned for liquids during the standard security check. Is there a valid reason for this second check?

High technology information system make it very easy to get around and get information; an official app of HKG is also very useful. Good Internet connectivity and Internet speed. Plenty of charging facilities. Flights usually on time. However, no lying-down seats in Terminal 1, making long waiting times a bit tiring. Power outlets are all in Hong Kong / UK style, thus not very convenient to charge laptops (USB outlets are abundant). Toilet paper is not very good in quality. Since HKG is very busy, the gates of flights will be announced not earlier than 2 hours before taking off, which means earlier arrive people do not know where they should wait.",9,Transit,September 2016,Solo Leisure,Transit,5,4,5,5,5,5,5

Only when confronted for being rude, she seems to tone down. HK Airport has probably one of the best infrastructures and facilities but is sad to be missing the human touch.

Quick processing of entry requirements and baggage out of the conveyor in a jiffy. Excellent way to start a holiday.

It was well over a kilometre and tha airport was packed, there were no electric cars in which to hitch a ride and the distance with a jacket and small case was simply too far. I quite enjoyed my flights with Cathay but regret that I will never use Hong Kong airport again nor BKK for the reasons that the distances are too great for any one with bad knees or legs and I am only 74.

It is unarguable that the airport provides a wide range of facilities and dining options, and the ground service is one of the most efficient in Asia. However, having been required to travel on a small aircraft (A320-200), I had to use the open spots instead of the boarding gates. One bus was used to carry all passengers on my round flights to and from the terminal and I could not believe how crowded it was in the bus. Ground staff were not very friendly, a big contrast with the lovely Japanese staff members I met just moments before arriving at Hong Kong.

Hong Kong,"The airport is clean and tidy although it is very crowded. You could easily find what you need from the signposts as they are everywhere. What I really like is that you could get bottles of water after passing through the security check which is well before the departure gate. Of course you may bring a water bottle with you and fill it in the water fountains, however, sometimes you just don't want to drink water. Many great shops and good discounts and what's more important is that sometimes they have limited edition products for the airports which is excellent. The food selection is huge as well, while I saw some comments saying that there are no food stall in odd hours, however, it only applicable to arrival passengers as the food stalls are all in the departure hall, particularly it provides great hot food which is very important for Asians. Of course, again, as its always very crowded inevitably you have to queue for food.

I remember his help was very useful and professional. I was also very happy to find a post office there, as I forgot to send postcards form the city.

Hong Kong,I arrived in Hong Kong during Easter on a morning flight from Singapore. The entire flow was as smooth as anyone can imagine. The CX flight was allocated at one of the closest gates to immigration and our baggage came out within 20 mins of waiting. As always the airport offered many transportation options.

Hong Kong,Great Airport in terms of efficiency and shopping. Plenty of late night snacks as well as some solid meals for lunch can easily be found. I had a 1:35hr layover from CX100 to KA996 (To Beijing) with lots of time for shopping relaxing and eating. Travelators make getting from Gate21 to Gate 506 quick and easy. After a late night snack of ramen and security I headed to gate 506. Although this was in a separate section of the Airport the MiniShuttle made the trip around five minutes long (including waiting).

Hong Kong,I had a transit here and this airport is really huge. I had to take a bus first to another terminal then walked around a mile then a train again and another hundred of meters to the gate.

Hong Kong,Honestly not a fan. I make the long trek to Western China every couple of months for 10-12 days and seem to always book through HKG on the way home from Chengdu. I find the layout totally bizarre and very odd to navigate. Security staff are not downright rude but totally disinterested. Shopping is very ample but rather repetitive and pricey. Like other US residents I despise the no liquids bigger than 3oz. rule even in hand luggage. For a 14-15 hour flight I would really like to be able to bring a large water bottle onboard. But it is the same on all Trans-Pacific flights that take me home so it's not totally fair to hold this against HKG. All in all after 3 trips in a row through HKG will be using PEK now that AA has added direct service to/from my home city of DFW. HKG is not the worst but far from the darling I see so frequently mentioned. I will take Toronto-Pearson every day of the week!,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I have travelled through Hong Kong International Airport numerous times. Most of the experiences have been pleasant until recently. 1). Customs: As I was going through departure security check point I was asked to show my bag after the bag scan. The staff there dug through my toiletry bag with his dirty gloves without informing of what he's looking for. Firstly things in toiletry bags are generally more personal. It would be much more pleasant if he could ask before taking them out. Secondly those gloves he's wearing were protecting him but had touched luggage and many other things it would be much cleaner if they could have been more considerate and asked the passenger to show the items inside (at least I would have gladly done so) instead of running his gloves through the items inside and leaving prints on them. Thirdly that wasn't the bag that he was looking for. Eventually he told me what he was looking for and I took it out for him right away. Wish he could have communicated that at the very beginning. That way it would be more efficient and much more pleasant (and sanitary of course). 2). Immigration: I've noticed that recently immigration staff at HKG would throw a passenger's passport back at the end of immigration check. I had seen such behaviour at other airports before but never at HKG until recently. Hopefully that's just one singular rare event. Although the immigration officer was skilled enough to have the passport still land on the desk I would much rather my passport not being thrown around at all.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I cannot understand how this airport gets such consistently good reviews. I found it large disorienting and illogical. I wanted to do two simple things. On arrival I wanted to withdraw some money from an HSBC ATM. Three different members of staff indicated where they thought it was. There is an HSBC Premier branch in Arrivals but it was closed and there is no ATM machine outside. I ended up in Departures and finally found one. One hour wasted to withdraw some HKD. On Departures I wanted to buy some last minute souvenirs. Apart from in a newsstand there is almost nothing. What is it with all these people raving about the shopping here Hermes Dior Louis Vuitton and Rolex are not the kind of shops I consider good local shopping - they are the same all over the world. The only good thing (and I will admit this is excellent) is being able to check-in downtown at Hong Kong Station and only having to catch the great Express train later.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Terminal 1 to and from DOH with CX. The usual long queues at immigration yet (as always) it never seems to take more than 10 minutes to clear immigration. Bags on the belt about 15 minutes after landing. The airport is still as clean and efficient as it has always been. In-town check-in still works incredibly well. Another positive is that some of the seating in the departure area immediately after immigration has returned - this is much-needed seating. Little else has changed since my last visit to Hong Kong but the airport is still a pleasurable experience and still way ahead of European airports.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Bangkok to Hong Kong return. This airport always amazes me of how quick and smooth everything works when you contemplate on the size and the volume of incoming and departing flights! Arrival a breeze. Hong Kong border officers do not stamp your passports any more. All is scanned in their systems and you get a small 4x4cm square paper with your passport info arrival and length of permitted stay. All takes a few moments. Many if not all airports in Asia and the west now seem so sluggish compared. Departures as well a breeze including security check. Train from and to the city is quick and clean. Wifi working and reasonable speed. Being in Bangkok its all the opposite here with extreme long walks and snail's pace passport control and wifi that never really worked.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Arrived 9th November 2014 on KA692 departed 12th November 2014 on AK139. Plus points: 1) I stayed at the Regal Airport Hotel connected to landside of the arrivals section. Very good hotel with good service and facilities and reasonably priced. 2) Transport links are sound with bus and taxi options. 3) The terminal itself had all the essential facilities and conveniences. Minus points: 1) All passenger conveyors - escalators and travelators - have bollards that prevent passengers from bring baggage. From a safety perspective this is understandable with escalators - there are always lifts nearby too - but less so with travelators. 2) I did not find HKIA to be the easiest to navigate to my gate - wayfinding itself was fine but there were a lot of directional changes walking and the need to go from Terminal 1 to T2 by train in order to get my flight from T1. 3) The satellite building where my flight was leaving from was not well set-up for food and retail - the main building was but suffered from very heavy queuing which I could not afford to wait in. General thoughts: My experience of arriving at HKIA is generally positive across the board save for the initial feeling of confusion at the sight of high-rising escalators crossing each other in an imposing arrivals area. My experience from check-in to boarding the aircraft isn't one I look back on favourably - at the risk of sounding lazy I felt that a lot of time was wasted on the walking required and the queuing in the main retail and food complex added to my frustrations. However staff were friendly helpful and the security process was excellent. Looking back the plus points far outweigh the minus points.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I find HKG's layout quite confusing and dizzying because of the Y shaped building configuration. About a decade back there was a common lounge area in the middle between the gates and the shops which is a good common meeting place for travel companions. It's gone now replaced by more shops. The only place you can actually sit down is in the gate area or (if you're lucky) in the food court upstairs. Food selection really not as extensive as Changi and not as much to do either. Immigration and check in was efficient and access to public transport is fantastic (which is good because it is quite a distance to city centre).,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Hong Kong airport is certainly very clean and has good facilities (water fountains etc) and plenty seating in the gate areas. Food-wise there are a couple of places (a Chinese place and a McDonalds) which while cheap for an airport are more than the same chains charge outside the airport in Hong Kong. The security queue's are almost always very fast (I have never queued for more than 5 mins even over CNY) but the immigration (arrival) queue can be a little frustrating and the bags don't always turn up very quickly (which I suppose is a comfort if you have to queue for immigration first it's not time wasted if your luggage still isn't ready). One tip travellers might be interested in knowing is that the shuttle train is not necessary - if you have time to kill and enjoy a stroll you can just walk past all the other gates to get to the other end of the train which travels underneath the main walkway. The main terminal is a 'Y' shape the train goes under the '|' part of the 'Y'. My gripes about this airport (my local airport) are that there aren't any relaxing places to have reasonably priced coffee it's a long way from Hong Kong proper and there is an annex which requires a bus to get to which is a frustration and not all that pleasant if you are unlucky enough to get relegated to one of those gates.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Rude staff. From transfer gate to airport lounge. A bit odd after coming from Narita airport where almost everyone seems nice - here you will meet people who are lacking sense of good customer service.

Hong Kong,Positive experiences all round. Arrived here twice left twice in the past month. It's fairly soulless is the only criticism I could possibly make about it. But for efficiency it is hard to beat. Immigration procedures were quick and easy luggage was fast to arrive and everything is so clearly posted. I loved too that those waiting for loved ones could actually see them on monitors before they emerged. It's a shame that Australia and USA have extra bag checks at boarding so you can't purchase water for the flight itself even after security. Guess those are the rules so be it. Altogether HK airport makes most western airports look very shabby inefficient under-staffed and unfriendly in comparison so I was pleased to go to Canada via here even if it made for longer flights. It was much less stressful and that's what we like.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I always have the same bad feelings when I'm here. They have lousy food options since they have extremely limited choices of western food. The main focus of this airport is to please the Chinese clientele. Its hard to even find decent snacks and sandwiches to bring on the flight. The lines are also often long for the food places. The restaurants close at 10-11pm so if you have a very late (or early) flight don't count on getting any food. The shopping is just like the shopping in HK Gucci Prada Louis Vuitton i.e. high end-shopping. Its hard to find interesting shopping to be honest.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,A really busy morning at the airport but still only took 15 minutes from check-in to departures. How can HKIA do it yet other airports take forever on a normal day.

Hong Kong,Flew from Singapore to Hong Kong on Sep 7. Arrived at 10pm. Gate quite far. Boarded shuttle train with no hitch. Immigration queues long but manageable. Being a local I passed through e-channel quite fast in spite of the queues. Surprisingly bags already on carousel. Marked improvement from my previous experiences Hope it wasn't a fluke but a real improvement by the Airport Authority over one of the weak links in HKIA's game baggage reclaims have long lagged behind Changi Airport.

Hong Kong,Departed to KIX on 26/7 and returned on 2/8. Very high efficiency and incredibly short queue time for security check and immigration. Generally clean terminal and the design of the airport is environmentally friendly as it allows large amount of natural sunlight to illuminate the terminal. The signs were clear and it is easy to find the way to the gate. The service enthusiasm of the airport staff and the food choice in the airport restricted area have rooms for improvement.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A

Hong Kong,4 times through HKG in the last month including 3 transits and one trip into/out of Hong Kong itself. Transit: aside from having to clear security as a transit passenger this is one of the best transit airports in the world. All very efficient. Great options for shops and food though be prepared to walk long distances (when connecting between two 11 hour flights I'm happy to walk a lot). Great variety of duty-free shopping though some prices are much higher than regular retail (caveat emptor). The wifi is too stingy however: should be up to 3 hours even if add-supported for free. Arrive: queuing for immigration but things move quickly. Bags come in a reasonable amount of time Again long distances to walk especially for the taxi queue once you're done inside. Depart: HKG is a double epic fail in this regard. Massive badly managed queues for departure immigration. Followed by an equally badly managed security queue. Given how busy this airport is all queues should be open between 07h and 22h. Nearly an hour to get through to the gates.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Flew from HKG-SYD-BNE in early May. Very spacious clean efficient with many shops. However I find the shops very repetitive as it's all duty free from all European/American branded names. While the airport is run efficiently and you will not find it boring but it lacks that extra personal touch that Singapore Changi offers i.e koi pond swimming pools massage area (in Hong Kong you have to pay to get into the lounge for massage) quiet spaces. Overall it's a great airport to transit and the food is reasonably priced. And of course the duty shopping is quite good.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A

Hong Kong,Had the honor of using HKIA last month when I flew on CX to TPE via HKG. Arrival time into HKG 1200.Though the terminal is quite crowded I managed to pass security rather fast and was at the gate of a flight about to open for boarding. Asked the staff if she could accept me on this flight instead of the one departing at 1555. In no time I was already seated comfortably inside the cabin of a B777 to Taipei. However if you land at HKIA during the peak going through security is a pain! So time yourself if you want to avoid the queue. The concourse is spacious not as crowded as Changi! HKIA certainly score points here. If you ask me to vote for the world's best airport HKIA is definitely my choice! I loved using HKIA for my trip to Taipei even though there are direct flights from SIN. The toilets are very clean indeed! However the food prices are quite steep! My forthcoming trip also to Taipei will see me using HKIA again.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Being one of only three 5 star Skytrax rated airports in the world it doesn't take long to see why. The airport is incredibly clean well sized and has plenty of on site amenities. On arrival I was through immigration in next to no time but the walk and then train ride from the gate was maddeningly long. The Airport Express train is one of the most expensive options to get to the city but by many standards is still an absolute bargain. My one big gripe with Hong Kong airport is actually about how functional it all is. Style makes way for function in everything. It is an incredibly boring affair with no flair or flourishes to make up for the monotony of it all. Personally I found the signage to be okay not brilliant and not nearly as good bright yellow signage commonly found in European airports. Some of the amenities are also really expensive ($200HKD for a shower seemed rather steep to me!) and the facilities for eating and drinking landside are a little lacking (Terminal 2 is better but most airlines use Terminal 1). One more moan - The time from gate to takeoff. The captain on my flight warned us that the taxi would take at least 20 minutes at minimum and that this is a regular affair at Hong Kong Airport. I have also learnt from several sources that Cathay Pacific leave transfer times between connecting flights that they have booked perilously short. Passengers have to be rushed through the airport by staff who meet them at the gate. They manage to get onto their connecting flights but sadly their luggage doesn't join them! Putting my moaning to one side this is a good airport with an excellent reputation and I can see why.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,We passed through this airport twice in the last few weeks for one night stopover each way en route to Italy. I have been here before over a year ago. It is clean efficient with a variety of options for food plus many options to get into the city. I found the signage easy to read and understand everyone was very helpful and maybe I am easy to please but no long line ups anywhere it was pretty easy to get through each time no long waiting lines. This time we arrived about 9pm on a Thursday night and 7am on a Tuesday morning. Departed midnight and 10.20am respectively the following days after arrival (just being one night stopovers) so there were a variety of times and none caused us any issues or problems.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Very nice staff service clear signage. Easy to pass customs and immigration and only let down is the long walk after train. Otherwise duty free shops are fully equipped. Facilities are great - toilets are clean. We were at Gate 60 but the staff at the gates weren't as nice as at check-in. Some airlines (e.g. Air France) now requires you to check-in at automatic machines instead of check-in desks which is a let down. It is hard to understand so we went to the customer service desk and from then on the airport was awesome. Would highly recommend.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Terrible queues at immigration especially if you land between 12-2pm average waiting time is at least 30-45mins. Most of the time not all immigration counters are open. Long queues at restaurants/food court. The only upside is the shopping.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I booked and enjoyed 15-hour and 13-hour connections for travel this past week. Huge open areas for walking and great tarmac views of heavies from all over the world. Visited 6 OneWorld lounges. Took a bath free meals (first class international). Numerous high-end shopping opps for those who can afford it. Great place for a plane enthusiastic to spend a day. Also there are pay-in lounges with showers. Great variety of eateries at least 3 Starbucks.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,We have come to this airport many times and find it is fine. Strong points: Modern design air bridges for all aircraft's. Weak points: Immigration : we spent up to 1 hr at the queue and my kids had to go to toilets twice at midnight. Long distance to walk far from city centre.,5,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I live in Hong Kong so pass through this airport a lot! It gets top scores but other than in comparison to other Asian airports I don't really understand why. It's not convenient to get to the Airport Express is only really suited for business men rather than locals and is also expensive (100$!). The busses are slow the airport is a long way from anywhere on an island. This is gripe number one because I often go to collect visitors so I make the trip far too often. My other gripes are that immigration is painful. I am resident but still need to queue up (albeit in the residents queue) which is better than most visitors - but still far too long especially on departure. The food/shop choices are poor. There is always an enormous queue for the food outlets none of which are any good (a basic sandwich shop would be nice) maybe McDonald's is the most popular (and cheapest). There is no cheap coffee either (except at McDonald's) and the shops are almost without exception fashion clothes watches etc. (all super expensive) which are useless for most people. Security is on the whole (surprisingly) sensible (that is not too strict on the >100ml liquids) and fast. It's clean and has a viewing deck (which costs money another sad point). Overall it's a shame this is my local airport given how far away it is from anyone and how pricey all the shops are. It's only saving grace is that the time to the airport is basically unchanging from most places so you can minimise your time there by leaving as late as possible!,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Probably the best airport I have been to in years. Wonderful navigation inside the terminal lots of space and light. Check-in security and immigration formalities were very fast and efficient. Lots of ways to get to the city - numerous buses MTR and taxis. ATMs are conveniently located around the building. Great selection of cafeteria and shops. Many toilets on each floor. Very convenient airport indeed.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,HKIA immigration seems to be getting worse each and every time I come to Hong Kong. Staff don't have the slightest understanding of service at all - no proper communication and if there was any it was certainly as cold as the Siberian winter. At least bags were delivered promptly so no complaints there. Everything was properly sign- posted - it was easy to get out of the airport and into the city with the bus park right at the doorstep of the arrivals area. Departing HK I used the check-in facilities at Hong Kong Station so not able to elaborate on check-in at the airport. Immigration was a bit slow few counters open and took about 15 minutes to clear a huge number of passengers rushing to catch their flight. Thankfully I got to my gate on time with minutes to spare thanks to the automated train (as Cathay had not even issued a boarding call despite flight being scheduled for take-off in under 30 minutes) and managed to do a bit of shopping. Overall the experience was ok just hope that the immigration will buck up in terms of their attitude.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,KA380 and KA381 to and from Fukuoka during Christmas holiday. On 25/12 the number of people was frightening very crowded. But still HKG is famous for its efficiency so queuing time was never a problem. Terminal generally clean although the glass windows seem a bit dusty. Airport staff was mediocre not so nice but not impolite either but the difference was obvious when I returned from Fukuoka. Check in boarding immigration and luggage claim were generally satisfying as well but got a problem with the e-channel which did not allow me to pass as the finger sensor was jammed.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Landed at 4.30pm and immigration was fast and efficient as there were staff to guide us to the proper lanes. There were long queues but it was fast and not really a long wait. The customer service was horrible and some were downright rude when we asked for directions or buying staff at the airport. However the redeeming factor was the city check in which could let us walk around Hong Kong without dragging luggage and finding places to store them. Airport express was clean and fast. Group tickets for 3 are at HKD210 which are cheaper than the ticket machines. The departure hall was again huge with many shops selling a wide range of duty free items and needs a bit of a walk to get from one end to another and there were not enough seating areas around. Signage wasn't very good either in the airport compared to the MTR stations. Overall a pleasant airport but needs to improve on customer service and rest areas.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I never understand why this airport is so highly rated once again our experience was of a hot sweaty dump. The signage was very poor and the customer service was dreadful. We were herded to one side of the immigration hall and told to queue up only for seconds later one of the immigration staff to start shouting at us and we were all told to move to the immigration desks at the other end of arrivals the whole place was totally disorganised. Once through immigration we had to wait a fair while for our bags something I have noticed other reviewers now regularly mention what happened to the glory days when our bags would be waiting after we got through immigration. The airport certainly isn't award winning anymore.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Great airport with excellent facilities and user friendly however long distances especially if leaving from gates 33 to 80. Staff friendly and efficient and from check-in to airside less to 15 minutes. Signage good although a bit confusing at times.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,At 6pm Nov 2 2013 the immigration at the north wing for departure 3 to 4 out-of-controlled queues were gathered into only 2 passport control counters. No airport staff was there to handle this kind of chaos. It was crazy terrible and ridiculous at HKG airport.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Long queues at immigration if there are a lot of flights arriving at the same time. Passport check pretty straightforward. Overall the airport is good fairly clean and shopping area quite good too.,6,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Plenty of places to eat reasonable range of shops clean toilets and plenty of them. Plenty of places to sit if you're prepared to walk a bit. Only in transit so didn't get the immigration experience but the transfer was smooth.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Travelled to Osaka Kansai this summer. Hong Kong International Airport is famous for its convenience and efficiency and of course it is very efficient taking less than ten minutes to pass security check and emigration. Airport is generally clean although some glass windows are sometimes dirty. Facilities are sufficient but the observation deck is not an impressive spot to visit. However ground staff lack service enthusiasm. Check-in staff were generally efficient but they don't try their best to help the customers such as not notifying the passengers that the aircraft and the seat are changed which I experienced when Cathay Pacific changed the B777-300 to B747-400. Customs and shopkeepers are efficient but are lack of smile and friendliness. That's why Hong Kong International Airport is famous for its efficiency but I am never impressed so much by this airport.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Traveled in and out of HKG last weekend long queues at immigration but dealt with quickly had a longish wait for my bag but it got there eventually. Travel into Kowloon by the Airport Express a breeze. On the return checked in at Kowloon station and took the Airport Express to the airport. Immigration and security quite fast. The thing I like about HKG is that while there are shops you do not get the feeling like at most other airports that you are in a shopping mall that has planes taking off and landing. The thing I dislike about HKG is that you have the ubiquitous golf buggies sneaking up on you with that annoying beep beep sound (Singapore Changi is the same). All in all a good airport better than anything Europe the USA and Australia has to offer.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,HKIA is actually bursting at the seams with standards of management going down together with increasing flight delays. This could only get worse if and when it is allowed to build another runaway because it is not able to hand its present people flow. This is said because it is a big drop from some years ago when it was voted best airport and it had newsletters in better English. Maybe the airport need to bring back its former management to bring it back to an acceptable standard.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Their standards have really dropped drastically from 5 years ago when I last travelled there. For an international airport it seems that almost half of the airport staff have a poor grasp of English or don't speak English at all! Terrible slow moving queues with very inefficient baggage check-in of 1 hour even at the express queue for passengers with online check-in. Immigration and security staff are extremely slow and inefficient to the point that I almost missed one of my flights despite arriving at the airport 3.5 hours prior my flight departure. The immigration and security staff appeared rowdy and loud. Baggage collection is very slow with 1 hour 15 mins of waiting! Hong Kong airport is definitely not equipped to cope efficiently with huge passenger volumes. For those who are travelling there do include a lot of buffer for connecting flights and arrive at least 3-4hours prior your flight.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A

Hong Kong,Hong Kong International Airport is still one of the most efficient airports in the world. I will never be frightened when I see a long queue for custom and immigration. The line moves so quickly. Airport is generally clean and comfortable with quite many duty free shops on the departure deck. Proud to have HKIA be the airport of my hometown.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Use Hong Kong airport frequently and found it to be efficient as it used to be. Choices of food and costs are excellent. I enjoy the airy and spacious waiting areas. I do not need to get to get my bags checked at the boarding gate and be locked there. Although it is quite a superb airport it needs more identity to show it uniqueness. All new airports are more or less looking the same with the metallic grey and blue colour scheme. Facilities start to show signs of ageing.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Recently travelled through Hong Kong and my main issue was baggage handling. The time it took from disembarking my CX flight to reaching the main concourse was over one hour due to being held up by baggage not coming out. I was particularly frustrated and anxious as I only had a 2 hour connection for a QF flight. As more people gathered around the belt by the time the luggage eventually came out it was chaotic and a matter of push and shove to collect bags. Problem was compounded with long immigration and security lines and 2 of the end counters for immigration were not in use which was very poor supervision by staff considering the situation. Once on the main concourse after 1.5 hrs whilst I couldn't get a thorough look around there weren't many Western food outlets and just lines of shops it really didn't offer much. Departures was just as bad and customs and immigration once again inefficient. Signage is terrible and almost missed my flight looking for the gate and had to ask several staff as many of them had a poor command for English and some were just rude as they replied to me in their native language and walked off. Very disappointed and would avoid if I could.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Superb airport sets the standard! Clean efficient and packed with numerous facilities that make the hours spent there fly. Excellent transport links to and from Hong Kong Macau and mainland China. There are numerous and varied restaurants and shops offering good value and the airport's free internet actually works! My only complaint would be slow baggage arrival on a number of occasions from Air Asia and Emirates flights I have been on. I believe this is down to an external company of ground handling agents.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,"I am a very regular traveller through Hong Kong International Airport and although it is for most services one of the best in the world their luggage belt delivery has been declining quite drastically in the last few months. Virtually each time I wait for my luggage an announcement is made that that ""due to a technical problem passengers on flight X might wait longer for their baggage"". In fact it has now happened to me 3 times in the last month. The delay was severe almost an hour. This seems to be a regular problem now and quite a shame considering it is otherwise an excellent airport.",9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Flew in and out of Hong Kong on Thai airways from Mumbai and Bangkok. Very impressive airport especially when you fly in from Mumbai. Great immigration - cleared in 5 mins. Bags a bit delayed getting out but all in all efficient. They need better signage to let you know how to get to town. Town check in facility was great - lovely to be able to check in your bag in town and then relax and get to the airport free of luggage. Definitely one of the more customer friendly airports in the world.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Very good airport. Terminals are clean plenty of stuff to see and great Internet reception. Would visit HKG again!,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,"I've read reviews which imply that HKG's standards may be slipping. I'm not sure I agree as I found the airport to be as efficient as on previous occasions – quick immigration clearance despite long queues and on the MTR into town about 30 mins after landing. However the airport seems to be heading the way of British airports and is becoming a shopping centre first and an airport second. The upper level airside used to have lots of comfy seats but these have now been removed to make way for even more ""shopping opportunities” and restaurants – yet there is still plenty of unused space which could be used for seats! It seems that the only way to get a seat without buying something is to head straight for the gates where there is lots of seating (and better views of the runways). My other complaint is that there is still hardly anywhere to buy bottled drinks etc. airside – there are several branches of Relay towards the gates but they have a poor range of products compared to their European stores. Is it really too much to ask to have a few branches of 7-11 or OK at HKG? Other than those complaints it's still a great airport and it's also still true to say that nowhere in Europe comes close.",9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,ADL-HKG. I had a very good experience with HKIA. The airport is clean and efficient. But for some reason this time they just couldn't get the luggage of my flight onto the belt. As a result of this all passengers and together with the crew were waiting inside the hall for one hour! I think this is unacceptable for a world-class five stars international airport. I really hope this is just a particular incident. And other than that all good. Custom and immigration is as efficient as usual. Still recommend this airport.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,This airport was efficient clean and extremely clear. Very cleverly designed and built airport everything works like a charm. A lot of people at the airport at the same time but doesn't get crowded. All facilities extremely clean and well maintained. Even though the staff doesn't always speak English at all everything works out very well. Nothing to complain about!,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Check-in was fast efficient and smooth even though they didn't really smile at all. Toilets are always very clean. Shops quite expensive.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Traveled around the CNY period. It was busy but that's expected at this peak time. Immigration and baggage times took some time prefer shorter but cannot say it is the worst I've seen. Place seems clean with plenty of facilities. Lots of free carts to use. Needed to take a long walk and train ride to get to the gate we had to depart from to KUL. Lunch time at the main food court was impossible as there were no empty tables or chairs. Took the train to the restaurants closer to the gate. Less line but fewer selections. Extra security for US flights but gate was close to the entrance and the hand check security was simple with minimal line or time. Been to places where this security line is a nightmare. No problems about taking this route again.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,HKIA used to be very efficient in 2005 but every time I have used it since I find that services have gone downhill. From the security which starts outside the restricted area to the dirty toilets supposedly cleaned regularly. This is the same people calling for the building of a third runway when they cannot even run what they have been given with taxpayers money.,N/A,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Extremely great airport. I fly to Hong Kong every year in the summer and the airport is modern and professional. Have never once been let down by their service and cleanliness.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I've been using HKIA frequently since its completion. After 14 yrs in operation HKIA is still holding its own in the brutally competitive world of airport efficiency. I'd like to see timely expansion to HKIA as there are signs that the facility is under pressure from rapid demand growth in some vital areas. The last couple of times I used the airport which were in Jan 2013 Nov and Aug 2012 the immigration queues were getting depressingly long. Although as a local I got to pass through by the fast e-channel the excessively long immigration lines were worrying and must be unpleasant for visitors. Baggage claim was also taking longer and certainly lagged behind HKIA's rival Changi. It's about time the Airport Authority got to work to up HKIA's game yet again to stay ahead of the competition. I look forward to the early implementation of the 3rd runway expansion plan.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Travel to HKG from KUL and back to KUL mid January 2013. Airport was clean with modern and refined architecture. There were long queues when we arrived HKG at immigration clearance but there were a lot of counters open which make the queue move quickly. The signage at the airport was easy to understand and we managed to get out to the bus terminal from terminal 2 easily. Check-in for our return flight was also smooth and staff were helpful and could speak good English.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Used this airport again last December for a vacation to Fukuoka. Proud to have a nice airport in the place where I live. The efficiency is high in this airport and I seldom see queues at the security check point as well as the emigration. The terminals are modern-looking and sufficient facilities as a global aviation hub. Terminals are usually clean despite one or two spots with litter. Ground staff are nice and quite helpful although not as friendly as those in Japan. Terminals are clearly marked and it's not easy to get lost in the airport. Overall good airport with high efficiency and satisfactory services and facilities.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Airport clean and efficient. Airport seemed busy because there some delays when I was boarding. Airport is also comfortable when waiting to board. Staff helpful and polite.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,The airport is very large and spread out so requires lots of walking its far from central Hong Kong so is a time consuming hassle getting in and out of town. Allow extra time.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,"Nice clean and efficient. For its size and busy state it doesn't seem crowded at all. Immigration was quick enough facilities were more than adequate and dining options were excellent. You can't really feel the size of it as travellators lifts and escalators were aplenty. Security was a little confusing as entry into the ""family lane"" were not clearly indicated and we ended up in the regular lane. Staff could have directed us to the right queue. My only complaint would be the layout. Not as organised as Changi and I had the feeling we were walking in circles because of the arrangements of the shops. Another thing I noticed is that they removed the areas where passengers could just lounge around before heading for the gate (remember that they were present 5 years ago) and replaced them with shops!",7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,It was further enhanced efficiency while I using the mobile boarding pass for my recent trip using HKG. All procedures such as information input seat selection and check-in I could process online by myself prior to departure. It allows me to save plenty of time to queue up at the check-in counter on that day. For departure all I needed was to get my mobile boarding pass on the phone scanned at departure and boarding gate all steps were smooth and no paper needed at all. I arrived at the airport 30 mins before the ETD. Similarly when I returned to the HKG the immigration clearance through e-channels for HK residents was also very smooth as just took me 3 mins. However when I saw the foreign visitors' immigration counters have long queues there. I think for HKG if improvement is needed efficiency should also be improved there!,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Hands down one of the best airports in the region. Flew into and from Hong Kong from Bangkok. Tons of people at arrival halls zigzagging and queuing by passport control and yet it took max 20 minutes to get through. Ample choices for transport to the city. Checking in in Kowloon airport train express station a day before the actual flight is extremely convenient. Doing so the departures could not be more easy passing through passport control in seconds and ample shopping on the way to the gates. Fairly quick but can get a bit too cramped. Great airport to use for connections but I do live in South East Asia and the location of HKG is more suitable for flights from and to the US and not Europe and elsewhere.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Flying to Hong Kong several times per year I have since my last trip applied for frequent visitor pass and received it so no queuing for me anymore up on arrival. Passport control can sometimes be slow but this is the only negative comment I can imagine for this airport. Airport is very clean and well organized. When arriving in Hong Kong after passport control your luggage is usually already waiting for you on the luggage belt or will be coming much faster then in many other airports I have been to. Transportation to any part go HK is fast and cheap. Departure from HKG is made very easy and to avoid queues just use the downtown check in service. HK duty free is impressive with many brands present. Being a very large airport you can use the fast train service to take you from one side of the airport to the other. Most airlines have their own lounges some are really nice some are poor depending on the airline.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,This airport is definitely one of the worlds best but its got one big problem. Don't go looking for a seat anywhere outside of the departure lounges or the eating areas. There are none. This is not a good thing should you be an older person tired and weary trying to get through customs and security.

Hong Kong,Best airport as everybody described but actually there is hidden inefficiency of this airport. We were travelling with 3 children and queuing for more than an hour is not a good experience.

Hong Kong,Hong Kong airport is like a second home for me considering that it is a mandatory stop for all my flights out of Taipei to Europe and the middle East. I very much enjoy the layovers in this airport as it is very spacious great facilities food shops relaxation and entertainment areas. However I have to agree with the last few reviews regarding the very long queues in security queues are getting worse and are becoming a real annoyance especially when you have a short transfer time. Immigration which I pass through only 20% of my stops in Hong Kong airport is by far the worse I seen in Asian airports. There are simply not enough officers for the volume of passengers passing through. Clearing immigration takes me on average 40 minutes which might be acceptable in US and European standards but not in the second best airport in the world.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Very nice staff service clear signage. Easy to pass customs and immigration and only let down is the long walk after train. Otherwise duty free shops are fully equipped. Facilities are great - toilets are clean. We were at Gate 60 but the staff at the gates weren't as nice as at check-in. Some airlines (e.g. Air France) now requires you to check-in at automatic machines instead of check-in desks which is a let down. It is hard to understand so we went to the customer service desk and from then on the airport was awesome. Would highly recommend.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,"Hong Kong International Airport is supposed to be one of the region's leading airports - and indeed it was and had been for a number of years after its opening. However I traveled through the airport twice in the last month and found it to be becoming crowded and on the second visit found the security screening slow inefficient and rude. So much so that the passenger behind me called it ""out of touch"". I agree. My flight arrived at around 6.30am from a long overnight run from Vancouver. Apparently security screening services are drawn down in lean hours - and this was surely the case. Tired from our trip we had to walk a long way to go through security screening as transit passengers (why such screening is necessary is never made clear and the rude security people don't answer questions). There was a line of well over 100 passengers some visibly annoyed that certain other passengers appeared to be jumping the line. When I finally reached the point of being ""screened"" I placed my things on the conveyor and walked towards the metal detector. I was told to stop for some unknown reason. When I asked why the security ""person"" rudely told me: ""don't ask"". It's time that Hong Kong authorities recognize that security is a two-way street. Passengers will co-operate if screening is professional and courteous. Passengers will not co-operate when screening is unprofessional and rude.",3,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I am getting very disappointed by the service provided by Hong Kong Airport in the past several months. First of all it is getting longer to clear the immigration and customs at both arrival and departure. The average waiting time is approaching 30 minutes. This is not acceptable compare to airports in Singapore or even Thailand. Second the wireless Internet and Power Outlet service is just not sufficient. I am currently sitting at Gate 18 and there is not a single open power outlet (only 4 of them are available and all are in use). Also the speed of Wireless Internet is very slow. In fact the same complaint was aired by a local newspaper not too long ago but apparently there is no improvement at all.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I've been through HKG many times and never faulted it until this time when the immigration queues were a disgrace. Barely 1/4 of the desks were open resulting in an hour's wait to get my passport stamped. I thought LHR had problems but they are nothing on HKG. Very disappointing as I've never had any issues with it before.,5,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Used this airport twice last week once arrived off-peak and had an excellent experience. The other time I arrived in the late evening when the immigration area was crowded with what must have been thousands of passengers. It took exactly one hour and ten minutes hour to pass through with only 4 or 5 immigration offers actually at desks which is nothing for such a huge airport and one of the officers actually left his desk halfway through! There were about 3 or 4 other officers just walking around directing people and managing queues which would probably not actually be necessary if they just got behind a desk and stamped passengers passports instead!,6,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,This is the most overrated airport in the world. My experience was bad from the moment I touched down. It took me one hour to clear immigration. Despite the long lines more than half of the counters remained closed and staff were simply going through the motions. My departure experience was equally bad the gates are scattered all over and the signage is not clear you had better arrive early or you might miss your flight searching for the gate.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,This airport is lovely clean comfortable and efficient. The only complaint that I have is that I was there after midnight and I couldn't find anywhere but McDonalds to buy food or drinks.

Hong Kong,SHA to SYD via Hong Kong with Dragonair and Cathay Pacific. This was my third time to this world-class aviation hub and I would say it's worthwhile to spend some time here just to enjoy during the transit though I could have chosen direct flight from Shanghai to Sydney. The transit was quick and efficient. After having passed the security check quickly I just entered one lounge. I took a shower and had some tasty food inside the lounge and of course got myself revitalized and was ready for my connecting flight. There were so many lounges shops and restaurants to keep you refreshed in the airport! The only thing you need to watch out is the time for boarding because the airport is so huge. Sometimes it takes half an hour to travel to the boarding gate so plan your stay in the airport well!,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A

Hong Kong,Used to be a fan of this giant airport but the quality of the airport is declining over past few visits. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon flight with a transit to another Asian city. When I booked my ticket on Cathay Pacific they offer a connecting flight with 50 minute lay over. Normally this should be sufficient for an efficient airport but to be on the safe side I opted for another flight that gave me 2 hour lay over in Hong Kong. Once I left the airplane I went to the transit area immediately and was surprised to find a long queue. The security area was not under staffed but they just didn't work effectively. Despite the long queue there was only one line opened (with 8 members of the staff). It took me at least 40-50 minutes just to go through security and had to run all the way to the other end of the airport to catch another flight. This is very similar to the arrival experience where there is always a long queue. On my return journey I travelled from Kowloon to the airport. The Airport Express was still a very smooth journey and the departure experience was so much better than transit. However the airport is starting to show its age and has become less exciting. Expensive duty free limited choice unless if you would like to buy expensive designer clothes.,5,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,The airport is clean and orderly the signage easy to understand. However queues at immigration and check- in counters can go from very smooth to very chaotic staff are very polite yet deliver no emotions at all. We were instructed to have a group check-n to Manila after gathering my friends passport staff told me to check-in individually instead. In order to avoid conflicts I asked him to put the 5 of us next to each other which he agreed just to find out we were miles apart from each other.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Landed and was putting the key in my door in 50 minutes. Carry on bag train straight through immigration with ID card. Try doing that in sprawling Changi or the distant airport at Seoul!,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I arrived at a peak hour. Had to wait in a very long queue for custom clearance it was terrible after a very long flight. The customs officer seemed to be unfriendly and it took almost 1 hour to pass through. I don't think cleanliness should be awarded at airport especially the toilets.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,If you arrive at an off peak time this airport is a joy - short queues and you are through immigration very quickly literally pick up your bag and walk out into the arrivals hall. If you arrive at a peak time - nightmare city. Long long queues to get through immigration up to 45 minutes is possible and most of my experience here is of this time length. It is big so you can expect a long walk if you arrive at the farthest gates to even get to the train to take you to immigration. Shopping and eating facilities could hardly be better though. Check-in is quick and easy. Signage is excellent.,8,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,This airport is excellent. I have been to HKG 13 times and the airport's services are very good every time. Impressed by efficiency and politeness. Airport is very clean and beautiful. The food and shopping excellent.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Regularly fly to/from HKG. Using a direct ferry from mainland China I arrived in a separate area of the airport for check-in and security (and no immigration control required). As the ferries only carry a handful of passengers there is almost never a queue for check-in and never more than 3 people before you at security screening. Within 20 minutes after arrival I can be at the gate. Signage cleanliness shopping is all excellent. The only negative aspect I can think of it that the transit area is dark quite depressing and too crowded while there is not much to do either in terms of shopping or restaurants.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Always seamless and efficient. In-town check-in is a big bonus for added convenience. Have experienced far longer lines and wait times at most other airports in the world. Have often deplaned and been on a train within 15 minutes.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,The airport staff cannot handle the flow of passengers at peak travel hours from baggage handing to security and immigration. Signs are chaotic and written in bad English and Chinese. They cannot even handle the present traffic yet they want to build a third runway which will add more chaos not to mention adding extra costs to travellers.,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Other reviewers rave about Hong Kong Airport but I can't see why? We've used it quite a lot over the last few years and with out doubt standards have declined. It's just too big and can take a very long time to get from the gate back into the main terminal. On our last visit on arrival despite a lengthy walk train ride then another good walk we still had to wait a fair time for our bags to appear - something that would of been unthinkable a few years ago!,5,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A

Hong Kong,Check-in took less than 5 minutes. Security inspection done in a few minutes and plenty of staff working. Toilets clean and departure areas are spacious - never a problem finding a seat. Arriving is also top-notch; immigration is speedy and baggage already on carousel. From stepping off the aircraft [at one of the farthest gates] to standing outside the terminal took thirty minutes.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Excellent airport all in all. It's intuitively laid out so even novices should be able to navigate it with relative ease. The facilities are good enough to make even a long layover - and mine was 18 hours - bearable. Its location makes a quick nip into the city easy. Staff were mostly polite and proficient in English.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Melbourne-Hong Kong transit to Manila. Transiting through HKG is awful. Only one security check available with two machines for 150-200 passengers. Everything is well signed. Immigration queues 40 minute wait clearly need to improve and then no trolleys. I passed several trolleys exiting arrival immigration thinking there'd be plenty at the luggage belt - found none. Finally immigration security at departure on the main concourse is a rugby scrum and then of course another check on the aerobridge just prior to departure delaying the flight further.,7,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,After using this airport many times I have nothing but more praise after each visit. The transportation services to and from the airport are excellent. The assistance desk at arrivals especially helpful. I arrived in Hong Kong and needed to go to Shenzhen China to continue. They assisted me to a limo bus through the Chinese border and immigration to the taxi stand to get a taxi to Shenzhen airport. The nice lady wrote out all of my requests in Chinese so I could show it to other service people if I got lost in the process.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,I voted couple of times for HKG for best airport before but I will not vote again from my last experience. Transit from SYD to PEK and PEK to BNE. Security staff are rude and unprofessional they all seem sick of their job and tired doing it. I had an hour between my flights from SYD to PEK. Getting off the plane I was stopped by airport staff who told me to wait for other transit passengers and then they will help me through security. A great service but after 25 minutes there is no sign they are going to take me anywhere. When I complained they told me I could go by myself - why make me wait? Will try to avoid HKG in the future.,2,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,This airport is a tale of two airports namely arriving and departing; the latter is rather good but the former is shockingly poor. On my recent trips (three times) immigration control takes between 30-45 mins to clear which is unacceptable these days especially given that most of the other lanes are quiet. Simple resource re- allocation would be sufficient but this seems beyond common sense. On my last trip a survey was being conducted as to how long it would take to wait in a queue; a confirmation of the obviously visible in my view; suffice to say once through immigration baggage is a mess with all the bags landed some time earlier. On the contrary departing is excellent. Surely it's not related to the incentives of PAX spending money on departure but nothing on arrival?,4,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Beautiful airport. Friendly check-in staff right through to the security personnel. In the separate lounge there are huge windows looking out over the airport allowing views of planes taking off and landing free internet and terrific shopping and food facilities. Hong Kong has an airport to be hugely proud of.,10,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Quite busy and sometimes queuing is long but something you would expect from such a busy hub. I used it twice for entering into China. Pleasant surprise that you don't have to go through Hong Kong customs on arrival. Ferry service to China excellent with many options. Other than that plenty of restaurants and shops to kill your time. Free wi-fi everywhere. Many departure gates are allocated far from the shopping centre so allow yourself plenty of time. Overall pleasant experience.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Fantastic airport used it 3 times in the last month and have nothing but praise. Clean tidy and efficient. Distance between check-in and gates can be long so allow plenty of time. Plenty of choices for food drink and shopping. Had no problems with queuing though security can be excessive at times. Would not hesitate to use again in the future.,9,yes,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Definitely share the view that Hong Kong needs to pull its socks up. It is showing its age with facilities like conveyor belts breaking down. This has happened to me twice on a recent flight from Australia I had to wait an hour for baggage. I agree with another passenger reviewer that they should try to get their management back on standard.

Hong Kong,Hong Kong T1 arrival from London on BA. We were parked on the apron with the rather surprising announcement that this would make it quicker to get through immigration. Immigration is not fast but not as bad as LHR is for a foreigner. Leaving the hall you are confronted with an overcrowded and confusing mess which is evidence that the terminal which used to be superb is now getting tired. Tried to take the bus to the hotel and the ticket office put me on the wrong bus. Fortunately I know my way around HK - but still from being a cheap option it became disastrously expensive.,3,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,It was one of the best airport but deteriorating management is showing its face in unclean toilets and fast food outlets in the restricted area. The queues are extremely long when it comes to non-Hong Kong residents. Management is losing its grip and should pull up their socks before petitioning for a third runway. They should improve on what they have.,1,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,HKIA is still my favourite airport. Plenty of shops and dining options. The design is open windows that offer views to the airplanes. Transfer and immigration lines can be long though.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A

Hong Kong,Overall a well functioning airport with easy access to train and an airy well-lit check in area. However queues at immigration flying in at 11pm were very long with at times no more than 2 officials to process hundreds of passengers! Then the official I got was incredibly rude throwing my passport about and barking out hysterically when he couldn't see my immigration form.

Hong Kong,A delightful experience at HKG. Clean and bright. Food is delicious and plenty of shops to spend time at.

Hong Kong,CAN-YYZ with Hong Kong stopover. The security checkpoint for onward (connecting) flights was excellent and I was out in about 15 mins. Food choices in the area after the checkpoint is decent (Popeyes Burger King Ajisen Ramen and a Chinese food store) and it showed a list of other food stores that will open there in the future.

Hong Kong,I have flown in and out of Hong Kong on numerous occasions having lived there for a few years. No complaints about anything. Immigration is usually fast and easy especially if you carry a Hong Kong ID card. Connections to the city are frequent albeit slightly expensive via the AirTrain. If time is not an issue take the bus - it is 15-20 mins longer and costs less than half the price of the Air Train. Baggage is efficient and staff are quite helpful. On the few occasions where I could not locate a bag or needed to be moved to another flight because there was a delay or cancellation with my flight the airport staff were accommodating and helpful. Food and shopping options are numerous. In summary one of the least stressful airports that I have flown through.,5,no,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,N/A,N/A
Hong Kong,Way to the airport is inexpensive and fast less than 1 hour. Fast check-in desks and staff clean and bright terminal. Great variety of food and shopping inside and outside restricted area.

Hong Kong,Terminal Two is a huge and empty shopping mall and does not serve its purpose as some smaller airlines check in there but one must get back to Terminal One.

Hong Kong,If you are in-transit and need to get transit area W1 then be warned - if you miss the signs then you are sure to need the help of someone but if your plane parks anywhere other than within 200 meters of W1 then expect a long walk. The travelators (moving walkway) do not take you in the direction you need to go - which is against the flow of passengers disembarking at gates along the route to W1.

However, the whole process at the custom check was very efficient. Lots of cafes and shops available to fill up the time while waiting for flights. The wi-fi works very well for me. The baggage claim section still under maintenance, I think. Its been awhile and the airport management need to check on this.
