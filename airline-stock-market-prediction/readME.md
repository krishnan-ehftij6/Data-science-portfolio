### Can Machine Learning Predict Airline Stock Crashes?

This project contains two python code files 
1) Using the prophet model to forecast airline stocks for eight airlines, across the next 365 days
2) A random forest model for IndiGo along with evaluation metrics to evaluate the model's capability in predict stock price

I break down aviation data into strategic insights- from stock market risks, customer sentiment or fleet purchases.
