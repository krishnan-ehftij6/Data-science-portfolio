Istanbul,"Not Verified | Beautiful new architecture doesn’t make up for an airport’s miserable customer service. Upon arrival security officers shooed me away from several busy passport control areas before I found one where I could get in line after a very long walk. Lufthansa lost my bag. Dealing with Celebri, their baggage handler, was a dragged out, exhausting ordeal. I had no communication from them after making lost bag claim for more than 48 hours. Phones were not answered and calls not returned after leaving messages three times. Bag was finally located four days later, when I had boarded ship for Viking cruise but was still in port. The Lufthansa baggage service, Celebri, refused to deliver my bag to cruise ship at the port or release it to Viking representative at airport. Celebri made me return to airport in person to claim my bag. The airport is a LONG ride from town. Celebri is hidden in a secure area and can only be reached by a telephone by an unmanned information kiosk. Celebri employee who answered phone said she was eating lunch and would come out to help me in ten minutes. Multiple other travelers showed up, called Celebri and were given various snarky answers as to when a representative would come out to help us. It was more than 30 minutes later when a surly young man came out and guided us back to the secure area. The only answer I was given for why I had to claim my bag in person was “Customs.” After four days without my suitcase, being forced to retrieve it in person at the airport was an abusive four hour descent into a hell of rude, indifferent Celebri employees in an airport that is already not passenger friendly.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I travel a lot and used IST frequently, mainly for transfer flights. Now I will choose other routes. Why? You need an average 20 minutes of walking between the gates, if you not happy 30 minutes and more. You have to consider a minimum of 2 hours transfer time (walking time to the transfer desk, security check, walking time to your gate). Short international transfer doesn't work at all. The staff doesn’t speak english, they are not supportive at all. Prices of everything are abnormal high.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul Airport is one of the worst airports you could ever visit. It is constantly under construction with people just hammering away, and it is just a terrible place to be. First, you can get free internet but you need to feed your passport details to a kiosk, which prints out a code you can use to connect for free for 1 hour only. 1 hour. At other airports it is free for unlimited use and you just need to connect to the wifi. Why the extra hassle for 1 hour? And if you connect to the internet, remember to use a VPN. I made the mistake of not doing this and soon I kept getting Blockchain phone calls. I knew it was the airport because of my unique name and how I use it daily, so I knew it was the airport. Your data is at risk if you connect to their wifi. And then we get to the insane pricing at the vending machines. Airports are expensive for sure, but a can of Fanta cost from a machine 450 TRY. That’s $13! £10! For a can of drink! Insanity! Oh, you want to go to Lost and Found for an airline to pick up something you forgot in a plane? It is in the arrivals area, so if you’re only transiting you still have to make your way through security and passport control, go to the baggage pick ip where the airline Lost and Found is, wait while they tell you “oh sorry you had to email us who was going to pick up the item so we can’t give it to you”, then having to get back through passport control and security again empty handed to catch your connecting flight. Genius. The one thing that is sorta okay is the Yotel hotel for long layovers you can sleep in airside. However, it is expensive at around $300 a room for a night, but they know you have no choice if you want to sleep so you have to take it. If you need to travel and can connect at a different airport, just choose a different place.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | We are a family of 3 with a severe low functioning child with epilepsy, hearing and vision impairment. We landed in IST with a short connection time. Airport assistance met us at the gate, and we told them we needed to get to our connection as soon as possible. They said they could use their powered wheelchair to transport my son and there was a buggy at the gate as well, but the buggy driver refused to transport the manual (not battery-powered) wheelchair even though we could fold it up. I ended up going on the buggy with our luggage and my husband ran and pushed my son in his wheelchair from terminal F to terminal B. The buggy driver even had the audacity to ask for a tip after dropping me off at the gate while my husband was still making his way to the gate. My husband and son made it to the gate in time for boarding but left us a bad impression of the airport service. On the return flight, we landed in IST for a 7-hour layover before our flight to ORD. An assistant met us at the bridge and, using our son's wheelchair, brought us to the IGA lounge as we requested and set up a time to bring us to the gate when it was time to board. Assistant came and brought us to the gate, he went to get the aisle chair, left it by the gate and told us that someone else would come and help us with the boarding. But when it came time for boarding, no one came to get us in line to board. There were two other assistants with powered wheelchairs in line helping their passenger board. We asked one of them if someone was coming to help us, she said to wait, someone will come. Then boarding started and the two assisted their assigned passengers on board then business class passengers started boarding. We were still left on the side even as economy class began boarding. The assistants came back out and we tried to get them to assist us, but they refused, saying that someone else is coming. We asked the check-in staff for help, and they refused to do anything saying someone will come and continued to board the rest of the economy class passengers up until the last few passengers. The boarding supervisor did not treat us with respect and kept putting us aside with lip service that someone will come and get us boarded with the aisle chair. Even when most of the passengers boarded, we were still left at the gate and the two assistants were just standing around doing nothing. We insisted on boarding ourselves but were prevented from doing so. In the end, the two assistants reluctantly assisted us through. Even when we requested help with our hand-carry bags to the plane, the check-in staff refused to help saying it's not their job. We were already stressed out with our son's damaged wheelchair, lack of sleep, and increasingly agitated son from waiting so long to board. We ended up boarding last with almost all passengers already seated. During this whole time our son was feeling discomfort and agitated from the long wait, ending up wetting and soiling his pants by the time he got to his seat. I broke down in tears seeing my son suffer, upset and uncomfortable, we were exhausted from half a day of travel, and felt abandoned at the gate without being able to pre-board and settle our son for the long flight ahead.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Two things strike the traveller about the ""new"" Istanbul Airport, firstly it is huge and secondly it is eye wateringly expensive! Its single terminal building means you can walk everywhere but there are some very long stretches with no travelators. Departure Gates are shown 2 hours before the flight and there are no announcements so you have to watch the screens for information. Some transit passengers have to go through security scanning depending upon the origin of the flight - this is OK but even with brand new scanners that should accept liquids you have to remove them for separate scanning which can slow things down. The overriding feeling is that EVERYTHING is overpriced. Can you justify spending EUR8.00 on a Pan-Au-Chocolat or GBP22.00 on a McDonalds meal? The range of high end goods available in the shops is amazing but again the prices are not ""duty free"" or ""tax free"" but - how much can they get away with! The net result is a lot of people wandering around but not a lot of buying taking place. There is very limited seating in the main areas, except if you have bought food. Good seating at the gates and reasonable boarding processes.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | Istanbul Airport is without doubt the worst and least friendly airport I have ever transited. My wife and I were Business Class back to Heathrow. On check in we were given no directions to the fast track lane and there was no signage, to the point it can't exist. It took us a full 90 minutes to transit passport and security (my wife struggles when standing for long periods) Having passed security (very curt) we walked some distance to the BA allocated Business Lounge, only to find queues to get in and no room to site down when we did. There was little time left as the gate was called open, so grabbing two bottles of water we walked the full distance to our gate, to find two staff and no plane. We found somewhere to sit until the board changed to boarding (although entitled to the business class lounge, the distance and packed lounge did not engender either of us with the desire or energy to return). As an International Airport which suggests it is the largest in Europe (this can only be by area, because there are certainly nowhere near the flight numbers to compete with the largest airports in Europe) it is very poor.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Ground staff lacking respect, ignored when approach them for help, arrogant and very disorganised in dealing with transit passengers and passengers with assistance.

I was put on the mobile buggy to reach connecting flight but the driver said my husband could not come with me and nor would he be picked up at all.

Also I had tried to approach a staff member to ask a question and she totally ignored me and kept walking away from me.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | The staff was incredibly unfriendly and unhelpful. Laughed at me when I asked for directions. Refused to give me food vouchers even though I had a 10 hour layover with connecting flight. That was when I was lucky enough to find staff, though. They don't have info desks, only these big orange video boxes that are supposed to help you find stuff, but in reality I found maybe one working in the whole airport. Even with a 10h layover I was unable to visit the city because I couldn't find anyone to ask directions to find out how to get to the shuttles, and the orange boxes were useless, and by the time 5h of my layover time had gone by I gave up trying to go out. The food is so expensive you want to cry just looking at the price tags (6€ for a single macaron??). So, difficult to get out, impossible to buy food (or anything else); at least you can relax and watch a movie, right? No, because you only get 1 hour of free WiFi. After which it's 6€ for an additional 2 hours. If you're going to deprive me of food and a visit to the city, the least you can do is leave me an internet connection. The queue for Security Check is ridiculously long for such a big (and supposedly ""the world's best"") airport. Most of the aisles are closed, and the check itself if very slow and old-fashioned. Staff will yell at you for following the signs that very clearly indicate to go in one direction or other (i.e. ""Security Check this way"" but then for some reason you're wrong if you go the way that's indicated, and are actually meant to completely disregard the signs and go somewhere else). Once again, I've never seen such rude and unhelpful staff.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | After flying from Hanover, Germany, we had a layover at Atatürk Airport in Istanbul. My daughter fell ill with a fever, and we had to take her to the hospital. We ended up staying one night at the hospital and another night at a hotel. When my daughter felt better, I contacted the airport to retrieve our luggage. After completing the necessary procedures and collecting the luggage, I needed to return to our hotel. I hailed a taxi that was waiting for passengers outside the airport. I gave the driver the hotel address since we couldn't communicate in English. Once inside the taxi, with my daughter on my lap, I noticed the driver had a camera and kept turning it towards me. When I asked him about it, he claimed that Turkish police require taxi drivers to have cameras. Suddenly, the driver stopped in an isolated area resembling a parking garage or loading dock. Alarmed, I questioned him, and he replied that he needed to drop off some goods. Fearing for our safety, I made an international call to my partner in Germany, explaining our location and situation, and asked him to call the police. I also threatened the driver, saying that the police were on their way. The driver, who appeared very threatening, started shouting but eventually agreed to drive us to the hotel. Ladies and girls, please take the following precautions when traveling alone: Get the driver's information: Note the taxi's number, driver's name, and any other identifying details.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul Airport has big ambitions but is far from the standards found at the best airports in the world. Although the building is spacious and open, passport control was fairly efficient with several gates to pass through, and bathroom facilities were modern and clean, these positives do not outweigh the many negatives. Firstly, food and drinks are extraordinarily expensive: 15 euros for a small beer, 40 euros for a kebab, 20 euros for a menu at McDonalds. For comparison, even in the most touristic areas of Istanbul, a large beer would typically cost about a third of that and would not come in a plastic cup. It just leaves you with a bitter taste of the airport seeing its visitors as walking wallets. The same vibe comes from the types of shops that occupy a large part of the airport. Maybe people willing to pay 50 euros for a simple airport meal are looking for a Louis Vuitton bag, but from the empty shops it seems that this audience is very limited. There is a huge Duty Free section, but they all sell exactly the same products. Secondly, WiFi is restricted and requires you to swipe your passport through a machine. Not only do you have no idea what is happening with that information (and why do they need my passport information in the first place?), it also just gives you one hour access. Not a standard that modern-day airports should have. Thirdly, boarding was chaotic despite our airline using boarding zones, but the gate crew did not care and just let everyone board at the same time. I would have been annoyed if I had paid for a ticket with priority boarding. Lastly, we used this airport for a city trip to Istanbul, but the airport is 40 kilometers away from the city center. That would not be such an issue if there was a simple public transport connection, but taking the metro requires you to change 4-5 times to reach downtown Istanbul, and the airport busses take 1.5 hours to reach a metro station on the outskirts of the city center. Luckily there are plenty of taxis around, but they come with a high chance of being scammed (our driver on the way back tried to make us pay twice).

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Firstly, this airport is big and has concourses from A to F. To get from one concourse to the other, you are required to get to a central main area. I arrived at concourse F and my next flight was from concourse B. With what might seem as a reasonable connection time, at this airport, you have to have more. There are no buses, monorails, or modes of transport from one concourse to the other. Distances are vast and it is always crowded. If you are anything thing but a fit youngster, you are in for a anxious and stressful trek after a long flight. Remember that gates close 15 minutes before departure. Now, there are these youngsters on Segways with a seat that can transport you from one gate to the other. It blew my mind that they charge US$20 for that service. There are golf carts that can take you around but they are so few given the immense distance to be covered. I wonder how many people miss their connections. One other thing that I noted was that the airport staff including those at the transfer and help desks are poor English speakers and get defensive and rude when they cannot communicate coherently. At the gates, boarding is chaotic. If you are boarding a flight to the US, the additional screening of in cabin luggage and of the person is a sham. 4-5 people are packed to small table and are asked to lay all your in cabin luggage, empty all your pockets, watches, belts, wallet, etc. There is absolutely no room and I saw people trying to sort out their cell phone from their neighbors belongings. All the while the people who are supposed to be screening are literally shouting and herding passengers through. So much for security screening. Everything at this airport is expensive. Consider that the country's inflation stands at above 60%. If you are connecting through this airport, give yourself plenty of time.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I had a horrible experience at Istanbul Airport on February 25. I was there on a layover from Cairo to Seattle. The connecting flight gate was about 1,700 meters away from the arrival gate and we were short on time. Because my son needed a wheelchair, the wheelchair person said my husband and I could head to the gate and he would bring my son ""fast."" We ran to the gate to make sure he would not wait long for us. When we arrived, my son wasn't there and the Turkish Airlines representatives had no idea where he was. They said the company that operates the wheelchair is independent. Running around trying to find an information desk or any airport staff who could help, there was nothing. All of that while the airline was announcing ""last call"" for our flight. I eventually found a random wheelchair person who told me that there is a desk near Gate A2 that could help. Nope. The two people at the desk who barely spoke English had no idea, and arrogantly requested me to go back to the gate. Back at the gate, I asked to speak with airport security, they said there was no airport security except past passport control! After everyone else had boarded, and still the airline staff had no idea where my son was, he eventually showed up TERRIFIED with a group of people in a cart. It turned out they moved him from a wheelchair to a cart and made several stops to pick others. We barely made the flight.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | I booked a flight for my unaccompanied 58-year-old mother, who is not tech-savvy and doesn't speak Turkish. Despite arriving at the airport over 3 hours early for her flight, the check-in counter opened just 2 hours before the flight. The officer denied her a printed boarding pass even when he was repeatedly asked to provide her with it, he stated that the E-Boarding pass on her phone (obtained through online check-in with no/old gate number) was enough. Despite witnessing her situation, he didn't arrange for or offer any special assistance. When she reached the gate mentioned on her E-Boarding pass that she was directed towards, she found out that the gate number for her flight had changed without any notice. After a lot of struggle and reaching the correct gate, she found that the flight had departed. She was left stranded at the airport for approximately 5 hours with no support. She was alone and kept asking for help inside, but nobody understood or helped her willingly, and any airline or airport staff she approached was not able to assist her or guide her, they kept on saying they had no information. There were no passenger calls made in her name that could reach her. And as a result, she ended up missing the flight.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I thought Istanbul Airport would have settled down by now since it was brand new when I flew first 5 years ago but it has not. This is a major huge international Airport that needs Customer Service booths 24 hours a day in multiple places to guide & help passengers. During the day there is still airport staff all over the place you can ask for help but God-forbid you land there at night needing to connect to another flight, you are all on your own in that 3-mile-long airport. There is no airport staff to be found anywhere to ask questions, its like a graveyard. They need to have luggage trolley stations all over the place but they do not. You have to find the far away location to get one & you do not know where that is. WiFi should be available to passengers immediately upon landing but its not. You have to go to special booths to register with 25 people waiting before you to get access. Not good. I landed there from LA later at night, had a 3-hour layover, got out of my gate, asked a couple of uniformed people right outside exiting my plane if they can look up my next flight gate number on their airport phones tablets, their reply is “I don’t know”! I cannot help you! (And, most of them don’t speak English). They pointed me to the big screens farther away to find it myself. They said “The gate number will be decided & posted on the board eventually before your flight”. You wait & wait & wait; no gate info shows up. And finally, when & if it does show up right before your flight, you are historically rushing & running with you carry on bags, exhausted from your previous flight to the next gate which is far far away. Mind you, this airport is like 8 football fields long & wide. Istanbul airport needs to install customer service booths in multiple spots at the airport to help passengers 24/7, people employed at the airport should be able to speak English fluently, should be able to look up on their airport tablet / airport phones & tell weary passengers what gate number they need to go & point them to the right direction.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Arrival: Clean airport and fast passport control. However it was difficult to navigate towards shuttles to the city and metro as not many signs are placed. Overall I'm satisfied with an arrival experience. Departure: Check-in and passport control are passed swiftly and without significant delays. While some security screening checkpoints are now providing an opportunity not to remove liquids and electronics from your luggage, some still require you to, and since you're being assigned a checkpoint by an officer in line, the need to separate liquids still exist and depends on a luck of a checkpoint being assigned to you. I find paid wifi (one hour free then at least 6 euros to continue) to be an off-putting decision that, considering high both food and beverages prices, is ridiculous and therefore feeling of being seen as a walking-wallet is rather disturbant. Toilets are clean and located almost everywhere which is a huge advantage for the airport considering its size. Agents near the gate seemed to mess up the boarding group sequences as well as departure time and therefore all passengers were standing in front of the gate for about half an hour.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | In spite of being a relatively new airport, Istanbul Airport faces several issues. Firstly, after a long flight, it's quite disconcerting to discover that the air conditioners within the airport terminal aren't functioning efficiently. The indoor climate is neither adequately cool or properly dehumidified. Moreover, smoke tends to permeate from the smoking lounges, exacerbating the situation. This requires prompt resolution. The absence of adequate lighting in the area in front of passport control contributes to a gloomy ambiance inside the terminal. However, the airport's most significant challenge lies in cleanliness and maintenance. The accumulation of dust and grime on the glass surfaces, which appear to have been neglected since the construction phase, coupled with unpleasant odors in the restrooms, damaged mats, and damp floors, is unbecoming of an international terminal of this magnitude. Additionally, the presence of dirt and debris on the glass elevators in the parking area is highly off-putting. Furthermore, the haphazardly placed signboards for tourism companies in the arrivals reception hall, along with the excessive noise generated by the staff in proximity, evokes comparisons to provincial bus terminals. In conclusion, Istanbul Airport must prioritize significant efforts towards enhancing its cleanliness and maintenance practices to effectively compete with its counterparts in the Gulf.",5.0,1,Couple Leisure,Arrival and Departure,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2023.0,trip verified spite relatively new airport istanbul airport faces several issues firstly long flight quite disconcerting discover air conditioners within airport terminal arent functioning efficiently indoor climate neither adequately cool properly dehumidified moreover smoke tends permeate smoking lounges exacerbating situation requires prompt resolution absence adequate lighting area front passport control contributes gloomy ambiance inside terminal however airports significant challenge lies cleanliness maintenance accumulation dust grime glass surfaces appear neglected since construction phase coupled unpleasant odors restrooms damaged mats damp floors unbecoming international terminal magnitude additionally presence dirt debris glass elevators parking area highly offputting furthermore haphazardly placed signboards tourism companies arrivals reception hall along excessive noise generated staff proximity evokes comparisons provincial bus terminals conclusion istanbul airport must prioritize significant efforts towards enhancing cleanliness maintenance practices effectively compete counterparts gulf,-0.9487,Negative,Global Transit Hub

Every member of staff from the catering staff to the transfer desk and security are so rude and arrogant. At times they are even confrontational. It is obvious that there is a lack of training in all areas, especially customer service and people skills. Another of my complaints is that I cannot believe that they charge €9.50 for 24 hours WiFi or €6.50 for 2 hours. I travel to many different airports worldwide and am never charged for WiFi. Istanbul is the only airport that is. As I can observe, trying to maximise profits from passengers rather than have customer/passenger satisfaction. Also the prices of all services are extortionate.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | If you have mobility issues, avoid Istanbul airport (IST) as plague I have travelled with my parents that both have mobility issues and the request for assistance was placed and approved long in advance. Upon arrival in Istanbul, we realised that there was only one person with a wheelchair, so my dad had to walk to the exit gate where we were left for a good hour before after my repeated discussions with the airport staff, the buggy has finally arrived.

After a lot of help on my side and with clearly visible pain signs on the face of my mother, we got on the buggy. They took us up to the waiting area at the entrance of the A gates. The area is located in a good walk from any toilet so how do they expect people to use them if they have mobility issues was not particular clear! At some point, we got a message that Turkish Airlines for the 3rd time changed our seats on the plane. Being worried that we will have little time to re-issue the boarding passes, I asked the woman to take us to the gate. The answer was no and she quickly returned to chit-chatting with her male colleague. I asked again with no reaction at all. This infuriated me and I asked for her name to write a complaint. After a short exchange in a broken English on her side, she informed me that now she is cancelling the assistance all together.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Had to transfer through this airport twice on July 22nd and Aug 4th, 2023. I had two small dessert silver plated forks in my carry on luggage on both dates. On July 22nd, security officer didn’t say anything about the forks in the carry on. On Aug 4th, when going through the security check to board a return flight, security demanded that I give her 2 forks. They took them forcefully and called “garbage”. This is very rude and totally unprofessional to call someone’s belongings “garbage”. These two beautiful forks are over 50 years old. They are a part of a family cutlery collection. That was a reason I didn’t put them in a luggage, as I was afraid to lose them in case luggage is lost. You can’t buy them anywhere. Calling something like this “garbage” is a complete disgrace, disrespect and ignorance. I was begging for giving me options how I could keep them as they are very meaningful to me. So many people were involved in this situation but nobody was trying to help or accommodate or provide a solution. They said forks cannot be taken on a plane for safety reasons. I suggested multiple options to resolve this including paying a fine, but they declined all the options I was giving them to save my forks. They were smiling and happy that they had a power to confiscate someone’s valuable items. I was referred to the Police officer woman, who didn’t care and didn’t bother to help. She was the one who called my silver plated forks “garbage”. When I was talking to her, she was on the video call with her relative. When I pointed that to her, only then she hang up. This is such an unprofessional behavior. Obviously, she didn’t do anything to help to resolve this. This situation made security guards very happy. They felt they are on top of the world for humiliating a passenger. When we were leaving, they were laughing at our backs and wishing us a good flight. Safety concern is a very weak argument, given that forks are allowed in carry on in many countries, including my home country. I also confirmed this with security officers, when came back home. Both dates I flew through 3 different countries and no one made this a problem. Do not tell me that this is an airport rule. All rules are created by people and can be negotiated, accommodated and solutions can be found on common grounds, if willing. There is no even a common international aviation standard on this item. I said to the security, that I am flying with an airline that allow cutlery, including forks, in carry on. On a plane, my meal was served with metal knife and dining size fork!

That said, its primary purpose is not to ensure you a smooth trip, rather to is to ensure you buy as much as humanly possible. This is where the problem comes in. If you aren't willing to shell out a A LOT of money then you will not be accommodated. There are lounges and hotels, showers and business centers for hundreds of euros and some have mentioned the airport itself is needlessly large and is intentionally so. The terminals are so wildly far apart as to mandate you sift through an endless regurgitation of a senselessly overpriced 1980's American mall. You'll see the same Bvlgari and Gucci stores 3+ times. The same Behemoth duty free shops are present ad nauseum. But when I say expensive I mean at least double. Everything down to the Wi-Fi is billed and at a high rate. No plugs, little room to sit or actually rest. Flight gates are not posted until 30 minutes before take-off and then are frequently switched. I waited until 7pm for the time of my 720 flight and it sent me to B terminal. When I arrived at B terminal it switched to F. At a cold hard sprint it took me almost 30 minutes to get there. This is both intentional and malicious; its sole purpose is to make you walk by everything one last time. I would boil it down to call it princess toast.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | My visit to this airport was, and I do not use this word lightly, traumatic. A colleague and I were redirected there due to a missed flight from Canada on our way to Cairo, Egypt. To say the staff was ill trained, rude, dismissive and grossly overwhelmed is an understatement. I will share the most egregious of the issues. When we first arrived, there was no one to help us understand what was next. Our connection was delayed and thus we missed our flight in Turkey to Cairo. We had to wander the airport with little to no direction to include many misdirection's and were actually rudely waved off like insignificant pests at one point without a word from airport staff that we attempted to approach for directions. Because of the delays (not all on Istanbul airport but certainly not helped by the staff) we had to take an additional COVID test because the time limit on ours ran out. The testing area was super hard to find and there was not good signage for it. Additionally a very angry worker rammed the instrument up our noses (I saw the person before us, my colleague and myself literally stagger back after the test) so violently I literally saw stars. He complained of pain a full day later. Turkish Airlines would not redirect us from our missed flight. We had to purchase additional tickets to be able to make it to Cairo. We went to the baggage handling area to retrieve our luggage. The man I spoke to glanced at my luggage receipt, and dismissively told me our bags had been routed to Cairo. He didn't check a screen or ask anyone. This he did while breezing by me as he left a busy line of people. When we arrived in Cairo, our luggage was, you guessed it, lost in the Istanbul airport. I certainly hope that these negative reviews prompt some change there. I will never step foot in that airport again if I have any power at all.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | What happens when ego is huge but there is no substance to back it up. Gleaming new airport is one of pet projects of Turkish president. It is huge to say the least. The rest lack some serious attention. It is highly disorganized with insufficient staff support. You are first screened for security at the entrance which creates huge lines. We subsequently waited for business check in for >30minutes. At one point the single person serving us left. Afterwards you go through quick passport check for international flights. Second security check is also decent. There is only one business lounge for international departures which makes crowding a certainty. That being said they do have an omelette station which was freshly prepared by several chefs. At the gate there is another security check. No announcements at all so people rush when they think the check in has started which creates chaos in a small space dedicated to the gate.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Architecturally and engineering-wise a very good looking building. And that’s were the good things end. I have traveled a lot, been to at least 15 international airports, from the smallest like ZAD to the giants like FRA. First of all, this airport and all its services are severely understaffed. Check-in counters are abundant, but only 15% of them are staffed. Same goes for the border control. There are two security checks, one when entering the building, and one after passport control. They are essentially same, which means one of them is a redundancy and a loss of at least 30 minutes of Your time. Never in my whole life have I arrived earlier at an airport. I was there almost four hours prior to the departure, and I barely made it to the gate in time. 80 check-in desks were operated by 20 personnel, and to add even more bad news, they were excruciatingly slow. Info displays are small and there are not nearly enough of them. After the passport control and the second security check, I saw on the display that my flight had only 5 minutes left to board. I ran and ran just to arrive and see that everything was late and I had 45 more minutes to sit and wait. So the main display was not up to date with information. There is no simple Wi-Fi solution, neither paying nor free, You need at least 15 minutes to make that work, and that’s if You know what You’re doing. I couldn’t check what the restaurants and shops offer at all because I was in a hurry, so I’ll leave that out. Last but not least, is the sheer distance from the city (Istanbul) and the means of transportation (or lack thereof). The best and only option for now is to hire a private shuttle or a taxi(cab). The public transport options like metro or high speed train are non-existent at the moment. If, after all you’ve read, you find yourself departing from this airport, please get there at least five or more hours before the planned departure.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | Customer service or the lack of it. Serious communication problems. All Turkish staff do not understand English well at all and will pretend they do by nodding their head and pushing you off to the next man so that it's no longer their problem.

It takes a really long time to get to your gate or anywhere you need to go because the airport is excessively too big. If a senior were to visit this airport it would be very difficult for them to acquire assistance because of the lack of genuine readiness to assist foreign travellers in dire need of help.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | A modern and spacious airport. Being a new one, state of the art buildings, architecture, and decoration, most travellers were a bit confused meeting new everything in IST. That resulted in a degree of discomfort and a lot of effort walking here and there to find what they needed. Most of junior staff that passengers meet everywhere in IST speak their mother tongue only. It would help a lot if those in contact with passengers are offered courses in basic English, French, or Dutch language. A noticeable number of staff and employee were tense. Probably, the huge influx of passengers caused by Covid-19 pandemic and the huge volume of work created tension or aggrevated it. Both passengers and IST staff were under pressure. A relatively modest number of employees and staff at IST were really nice, calm, and helpful. On my way to the gates to board I requested assistance from those two young employees. They got two wheelchairs and made sure we were comfortable. Thank you Ihsan and Aysun. A good point was made by a Turkish Airlines staff at check in desk. She offered us taking our carry on bags with the check in luggage. That was a nice gesture especially with senior people freeing them from carrying bags throughout the layover hours.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Istanbul Airport to Milano. Using this airport since opening. The airport and facilities are rapidly improving, the airport management is really learning by experiencing it. They need urgently new lounges. This time I was unlucky and had a gate that was far away, had to walk for 15min, but at some other airport you will find the same, understandable. The only big minus is the rude security staff at entering terminal that can not even put 3 basic English words together and be nice and have a smile. The ladies security especially are far worse. Can not even say hello, please, welcome, wait please or any basic word that they need at their level of work. They need to learn in total 5 basic sentences to welcome people and help them, but no none of them learn. Besides the security check point, the overall experience is pleasant.

Istanbul,"Not Verified | I have transited through Istanbul airport, the new one, twice during my trip to Spain. The airport is really huge and well built.

But the airport is really clean and you can feel that they have gone an extra mile about cleanliness. The duty free is awesome, you can get a flavour of Turkey alongside all the shiny things people love to buy in airports. They have quite a few options of fried chicken and pizza in the food court as well which is situated at the top floor, but my expectation was a bit high on this. The airport has more than enough cafes and bars to take care of your appetite. They also have place for Turkish foods and sweets (kebabs and stuffs). It's a separate place than the food court and a bit hidden. But if you can't find it, don't shy away from asking ""How may I help you"" people about it. Airport stuffs are really helpful and they were almost every corner. They were helpful about everything except flight rescheduling. I suppose they didn't have much information about that. This airport has a lot of places for sitting or sleeping. So, I wouldn't mind taking a good 3-4 hours' layover here.

Istanbul,"❎ Not Verified | I flew in on a business trip. Was in awe of size: its immense. On arrivals, no wait at passport control. Breezed right through. Long walk and airport felt 'empty' so walk seemed longer. But as more people use it and it grows to its capacity, I think the crowds will make it feel smaller and less empty. The departure area is where you get to see the true beauty of the airport: 1. Large open plan and huge shopping areas. 2. Lots of people in 'Ask me' outfits to get help from. You need it because of its vast size and you don't want to trust signs and go all the way to realize you should have turned 300M meter back. 3. Business class check in area has its own sofa comfort seating. 4. Access to Star Gold lounge was all through frictionless scanning of boarding pass. 5. An amazing race car track. Here are the things that were things they need to fix and fall below the standard of a world class airport: 1. On arrival in the customs area, there is a set of uniformed officers. Opposite them was a pair of civilians. One in a red polo shirt. He asked me to go for secondary screening. That is not an issue. But why is he standing as a civilian with no visible ID. I asked his colleague who they were to be asking this since I see the uniformed people on the right. She produced her id. This is just plain stupid. I am sure there are reasons that they need to be under cover in civilian clothes for catching bad guys. But when you are standing in official capacity, then produce your id. How is an arriving passenger to know that this is not a cab driver that entered the pick-up area and this is not where the receiving area starts? I have never seen this in the 30 cities in different countries I have traveled in the last year. Istanbul airport: have your plain cloth officers stand next to the uniformed ones and have their badges visible. This is not a secret police state where you expect people arriving to obey you just because you have a red polo shirt on. 2. The wifi process in the lounge was a bit convoluted: you scan your boarding pass and it prints a tag with your 'unique' name and password to access the wifi. I am sure they are doing this for some marketing reasons to tie your name to your laptop address to your wifi. But its painful to use the wifi (enter this 'unique' id, and odd ball password). Why have the frictionless entry on the entrance to lounge if you are going to ask the traveler to slow down and spend extra time entering stuff. 3. Signage for lounges is good when you come down the long terminal walk. But its not easy to see where you are supposed to hang a left for the lounges. Had to ask. The only sign thats there is on a tv display at lower level than where you expect to see it (i.e. the other 45 signs that navigate you to the airport).

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | It took 35 minutes to arrive airport from Maslak CBD by car. Entrance was very quick as the new airport terminal has seven gates and plenty of security screening boots. Since I did my online checkin, I proceed to the passport control and completed procedures and security check in less than two minutes. All those formalities were quite smooth and rapid when it is compared to old Ataturk Airport. The new terminal is spacious and architecturally inspiring. Yet some finishing materials are poorly detailed. It gives the impression that the airport was finished in a rush. Inside there are a large number of duty-free shops offering a wide range of brands & goods. The food court is on the upper floor and accessed by escalators. It seems the area and choices are limited for the large airport. This is little bit annoying. It took 15 minutes walk to go to my gate after passport control. The longest walk I guess would be 25 minutes if your gate is on the extreme corner. Toilets were sufficient and clean, yet the amenities were basic. It requires more efforts to catch the standards in Doha, Dubai or Singapore. What is really missing in this brand new airport is quite corners equipped with more comfortable seating.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | The new Istanbul airport is a glorious Chaos in all fairness! This review is based on the multiple transits I have had through the new Istanbul Airport during the past month (April-May 2019). It is a grand modern structure which has a lot of potential to be a good airport in future. It was a complete compromise from the word go. Chaotic, messy, unplanned. Mismanagement and lack of planning visible all around. Sub standard materials, furnishing and fittings are used in quite a lot of places which has started wearing off and breaking apart already. There was deficiency of seating areas, toilets, waiting spaces, charging stations, trained personnel, directional guidance, food options and mobility assistance. While the fact remains that it's a new airport which is still evolving and improving, there are quite a lot of basic facilities which are lacking. Hence, the overall experience was BAD! Untrained staff with a rude attitude was standard and consistent throughout the airport with very few exceptions. Most couldn't speak English (Without holding that against the staff, it is crucial for an international Airport which deals with majority passengers from non Turkish speaking countries to have bilingual staff who could converse and guide the passengers/customers effectively in English and/or other prominent foreign languages. Many staff were unruly with their uniforms and manners too. Most were busy on their phones and didn't care much about their work and the passengers. Beyond the visible language barrier, there was a prominent sense of unwillingness to help too in spite of approaching and enquiring with them which added to the overall bad experience. Internet connectivity is quite the joke! There is no wifi internet connectivity anywhere in the airport. And this scenario exists in 2019 in a brand new international Airport which is claiming to be among the best airports in the world. There seems to be a guest network which doesn't work. And some passengers have claimed to have accessed it, but with a time limit of 1 hour. After that the wifi apparently gets blocked and could not be used from the same devise again. In my case, I couldn't even get it started which was the case with most airport users. This is not a pedestrian friendly airport. It's massive in size with no or little mobility assistance. To put it into perspective, it took me 25 minutes of brisk walking to reach my gate with no train lines or any other mode of assistance available anywhere around. Have also heard stories of passengers being demanded money for taking them on airport buggies. Haven't experiences it personally and hence won't comment. There seems to be little thought and planning which went into designing mobility and accessibility for disabled passengers too. Food and refreshments : There are quite a few cafes opened through out the airport (very few near to many boarding gates though). But there's a lack of choice when it comes to proper restaurants. It's mostly fast food joints which are in offer. This is an airport with good potential to do it right. In it's current form, it's in a sad state though. Haven't intentionally mentioned about none of the lounge programs (PriorityPass, Loungekey, Dragon Pass or any other) being accepted in any of the airport Lounges.

WiFi is limited only if you have the airport app if you can figure how it works. The airport is huge but is logically designed and easy to get around. The Turkish Airlines and airport app do have maps of the airport. Just as in Atatürk passengers from the US don’t have to go through a security check with regards to connecting to their onward flight and can go straight to the terminal. But even going through the security check did not take long as the lines were short at least at 9:00 am. If you have a connection of 75 minutes or less you can take a short cut though I didn’t see any visible signs. Yes it did take time for the plane to taxi for take off and landing but it was no more than 15-20 minutes similar to CDG.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | This airport is a shocker, I appreciate it is new and still finding it's feet but most of these complaints are fundamental design or money grab issues 1. Runways are miles from gates, of my 4 trips, 3 took 25-30 mins taxiing time 2. In most cases no air-bridge, you have to climb on a bus from the gate and walk up the steps outside, like a regional airport. Even the shuttle ride was a good 10 mins! 3. No free Wifi. But it is available for the TA or IGA lounge patrons (one shop said they’d give me the password if I bought lots of stuff) 4. Have to pay 1 euro for trolley rental, with a long queue at the vending machine. You can get it refunded if you walk about 1km to the return point but who has the time? 5. Approx. 1 hr trip to Istanbul centre on a good day. No fast rail yet, choice is public bus or taxi. Beware if there is traffic congestion on the freeway (I had a 5km long jam inbound one time) 6. Food vendors expensive. 40TL for an ice cream and the staff I engaged spoke only Turkish and were rude when I couldn't understand them. 7. Departure hall immense. No support for people with mobility issues. There are motorised wheelchairs running around like in Singapore but they tried to charge $20US. It's ok for the well heeled if you pay 59 euro to enter the IGA lounge then can get a buggy to the gate. 8. Not enough seating in the departure lounge, people were lying on the floor 9.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | I travelled with this airport in April and May for a holiday with my partner. When we heard that we were going to the new airport, we were very excited at first, but found out later this is merely a piece of over-selling hype that, in no way, can compete with other neighbour international airports. The average taxing time is 30 minute. You did not see it wrong. If you want to feel what does it look like driving on ground, on an aircraft, come to this airport. The infrastructure of this airport is poorly designed. The toilets are extremely sparse and it seems the builder has forgotten to build three times more toilets in the airport. You need to walk with extremely long distance in order to get through check-in desk, security, and gate. The staffs here are poorly trained. Most of them can only speak with basic English. For those who know some English, they don't know how to say it politely: when we arrived to this airport by a 5-hour delayed flight, the Turkish Airlines desk in this airport, which are with the most unhelpful staffs I have ever seen from my experience of travelling more than 40 countries, shouted at me like I am a low-class citizen.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | This airport is a disaster particularly when compared to the old (sic), wonderfully functional Istanbul Ataturk. The ground use plan is a disaster. The terminal is in the wrong place relative to the runways and the taxiway system is a joke. One wonders if the people who designed the airport did traffic movement simulation studies. Given the lengthy aircraft taxi distances and structural bottlenecks they do not have a snowball's chance in hell of even coming close to their traffic projections. The airport is surrounded by high terrain and is subject to blowing sand. THY aircraft have to be fitted with engine protection covers when parked. When we used the airport there was also thick ground mist. Signage is appalling. Distances within the terminal are unacceptably long. Apart from high end shops orientated towards the super rich the commercial offer is worse than Ataturk, paricularly food-wise. On departure the only hot drink we could get was tea from a barrow boy near the gate. There was no coffee. The squeamish should avoid going anywhere near the toilets.

Istanbul,"✅ Trip Verified | A beautiful Airport. Cons: Prior to passport control: Only 1 small cafe with 10 chairs, no assistance for early bag drop off. 1 hour away from Istanbul Ataturk Airport City with only a bus service. The bus service is done by a coach and a standard bus service. The coaches sometimes do not stop at specified locations, so you will need to make sure you leave early otherwise you might miss your flight. Airport is too big that involves a lot of walking with few aids to speed up reaching your gate. Amenities: No water dispensers, wifi requiring sim card to receive text which contains password, slow wifi. Food court is hidden away, the vendors are short staffed and do not have enough supply which means most of the food is not available. Food price is extortionate. Queue times are long in excess of 20 minutes with waiting times for food in excess of 15 minutes. This is very impractical and it was not even lunch time. Unnecessary number of security checks: upon entering the airport a body and baggage scan. Then at baggage drop off 2 separate confirmation checks that you are supposed to be flying. Then again at passport control full body scan with baggage scan. Then at the gate, 3 confirmation checks that you are supposed to be on the flight with another body and baggage check involving drug swabs.

Dubai,"Not Verified | My wife and I were returning from Bologna to Singapore. As we were traveling through Emirates , we had to transit in Dubai. We got down from the plane and were herded into a bus. As we alighted from the bus, we walked to the Flight Connections marked in Red. We were then led to the security check and we chose to go to the extreme left lane . At the conveyor belt, the security officers started shouting at the passengers to remove the watches, belts and anything that was metal. That is fair enough as I understand that it is to not slow down the metal detector screening. I complied with their instructions. At the Conveyor belt, there was security officer who told us to put all our belongings into the tray and then put it into the conveyor belt. My cabin luggage was too large to fit into the tray and I had put in on the conveyor belt. This is similar to what we do in all airports including Singapore Changi. Then this security officer started shouting at me. My wife was treated even worse, she went into the metal detector and then was told to return and put her shoes into the conveyor belt. Only that there was no tray for her to put it in. So she asked the same security officer if there was a tray available . The security officer shouted at her and said ""JUST PUT IT IN A TRAY"" My wife had no choice but to put it in the same tray as my cabin bag which was already jutting out from the tray. Very unhygienic but we had to comply. My wife and I were furious with this security officer and we approached another security officer wearing a jacket . He was standing past the metal detector. He told us that he registered our complaint and speak to the officer involved. When I returned to Singapore on the 16/09/24, I decided to write to Dubai Airport Customer Service to give a feedback on this incident. However, I was met with an even worse encounter. When I wrote about this incident to the Dubai Customer Service, I had given them my name, the location, the lane, the description of the officer in question and the description of the security supervisor. They then wanted me to give my passport, my boarding pass, a picture of what I was wearing on that day and provide again the location of the incident that happened. When I asked them, they said that Dubai Airport Police required it. I told them that their demands were unwarranted and it felt as if I was being investigated instead of the officer in question. They then told me in their own words, ""Without providing the required details we will assume you no longer interested in this complaint and we will be closing the case from our end."" I am flabbergasted by this kind of attitude. They treat us like cattle and have no regard for their visitors to Dubai. They just don't care and you reach out to them to give a feedback, they treat you like a criminal. This would have been easily resolved if they actually saw their own CCTV, went back to the day and location of the incident.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been coming to Georgia for 4 years. It’s a place a love visiting. I am African. The first year I visited Tbilisi international airport I had no issue at immigration, the staff were so friendly and I felt so welcomed! I was even greeted with a bottle of wine! No complaints! Sadly as the years have gone by I have noticed the treatment of people who are non Europeans is very different from European/Caucasian passengers at immigration. The second year I came with my friend and we were interrogated like there was no tomorrow! Why are you coming here? What is in your bag? We had everything scanned! And I believe it was purely because he (Caucasian) was with me (African). The third year the same thing I came with my girlfriend (European) and we were both stopped! And interrogated again. Making you feel like a criminal. I saw countless Europeans walk and stroll through. The 4th year I was greeted by immigration with so much attitude, I provided all documents needed, she asked me if it’s my 1st time in Georgia I said no it’s my 4th time. She immediately closed my Passport and said “well if it’s your 4th time you should know you should go to that room”. Now at immigration is a secondary room where there were three officers who asked me where I’m going where I’m coming from and let me go. Back to immigration to see another immigration officer to do exactly what I was doing in the 1st place. The attitude and rudeness of the 1st immigration officer was horrendous. Over the years I have seen that Non Europeans are all told to go to that room. I have seen them (African, Asians, all non Europeans) lining being interrogated and harassed regards-less if you have all documents needed. Sadly to come to Georgia I have to experience this more and more over the years… I think this will be the last time I come here.

There didn’t seem to be any system of checking and it seemed like staff were just asking random people then ignoring others seated next to them.

We have been flying for over 10 hours, touching things, and are exhausted. I politely ask why, and he proceeds to say, because he can not tell that it is me. First of all, you’re lying the camera is called face recognition, whether I have my contacts or glasses on. As I politely told him, my hands not only are dirty, but I have no way of taking them out while in a line with no contact solution.

That’s not the best experience we had. It gets better. As it’s now time to leave Dubai, we were NOW told our Covid tests weren’t valid, and to return to the states it has to be within 24 hours, not 72 hours….oh how lovely.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. My trip CGK-DXB-AMS. Arriving from Jakarta on EK357, arrived at 23.00. Aircraft parked at remote stand. Transportation by bus to terminal A. The bus itself is great. After a 15-20minutes bus ride, we arrived at the terminal, I followed sign ""connection"", went thru security. No queue, smooth. Okay, usually will find out a departing gate for the next flight. Flat screens show connecting flights, guess what? Only Emirates flights are shown on these screens? Nowhere, but really nowhere connecting information can be found about other airlines. Many yellow shirt staff with Information to be seen. I asked where to find KLM gate, answer: traveling to Kuala Lumpur? OMG, my response was that KLM is an airline not a city? My trust in her went from 10 to zero in a second. I approached someone else, she understood my question. Sir, you go to terminal 1. But what terminal am I now? I had to take a train and then a bus to terminal 1. How to find this train? well no signs to be find anywhere. I ended up in B. Asked again where to find the train, take escalator down, and then blah blah blah. Was in B now. Okay, now to find a bus - where? No clue. No sign, wanted to look a tv screens where to find my KLM flight, still no information about non Emirates flights. After asking 4 times to staff where to find the bus service, I got confused. Go against security flow, use staff exit. Huh? Staff exit? Makes no sense. Then found a door for the bus, employee there informed me that bus interval timings is 40 minutes. I had to wait for 15 minutes. This bus trip took me another 15 minutes. Then ended in terminal 1. Security check, again. Long queue, very rude local staff at detector. And finally, tv screens with departing flights of D pier. Long walk to D19. Okay, first entered bus from platform at 23.15, was at my departing gate at 00.45! Took me 90 minutes to find my gate. No time to relax, eat, shop whatsoever. Luckily my transit time was 3 hours.

Dubai,"I have ""enjoyed"" Dubai many times over the last few months and it is a truly awful airport. Access to it or from it by road is really bad, especially at peak times and there is no effective public transport system. Terminal 1 is the non Emirates terminal and is by far the best at Dubai. The issues tend to be that it is a long walk from your gate and you have to use a not very efficient transit to get to arrivals or departures. I arrive very early in the morning and it tends to be efficient in immigration (if you use the e-gates) and on baggage, There is plenty of room outside to get picked up. Departures is a whole different matter - I tend to leave late Thursday and at that point the terminal has de-generated into chaos. No room outside for your car to pull up, hassling porters and complete disrray inside as this is a peak departure time. E gates speed ,you up but the queues at security are horrendous. This airport is mainly about transiting passengers and is designed as such. There are a few decent restaurants and lots of shops but it is a deeply unwelcoming place. Terminal 3 - the main Emirates terminal is horrendous. On arrival the queues can be extremely long, if you arrive out of hours the transit trains take an eternity, the layout when you get off the train for transit versus arriving passengers is unclear and the process to get your bag is arduous. So far so bad, It then gets worse - the queues for taxis are endless, if you have arranged a driver it will take him at least 30 minutes to get out of the terminal parking area On departuer there are all of the same problems of T1 but multiplied by the volume of activity - it is now so bad that I fly to Manchester via Heathrow rather than take the direct fllight as the T1 experinece is so bad. Less focus on shopping and forcing numbers up, and more focus on looking after travellers would not go amiss.

After the first time I went through Dubai I filled in one of the airport's online complaint forms. The airport completely missed the point, replying that the loos are cleaned n times per hour.

And my wife tells me that the female loos are not much better either. The result is that passengers arrive at the gate at the last minute for their flights, which is difficult for the gate staff and ATC. The whole situation is completely unacceptable.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I've arrive from Copenhagen and after two days I departed to Warsaw. Both of them Arrival service was located at the end of the airport which was almost 15 mintues from pass control. Due to midnight time all security and luggage control didn't took much time. I was outside the airport in around one hour after landing. My flight back was starting at 8:05 AM so I was at the airport at 3:30AM and dropped my luggage in empty counter. I had to pay for over-sized luggage in separate counter and then I've got a boarding pass. Security control in Dubai is a completely different story. I can't understand why any of cables except laptop and mobile chargers. Due to my profession (network IT), I'm carrying many of the cables in my cabin bag in separate plastic bag (ethernet, USB printer cable, USB-RS232 converters, computer power cable). On my previous flight a lot of them was confiscated and this time I was more clever and put them to checked-in luggage to avoid same action. However due to remaining electronics all stuff was removed from my bag and this takes a lot of time wasted.I really didn't understand why cables cause a problem only in Dubai but they are no problem in any other airport around the world. However when I got finally to terminal I found a hundreds of people lying everywhere around on the floor. Whole airport looks like shelter for homeless people. I found one gate unoccupied and sit ther to use an internet. Connection was quite ok, enough to watch movies but internet disconnect very often, more less each 10-15 minutes was off.

Dubai,✅ Trip Verified | Arrived in Dubai on time and went down to security which took 15 minutes and proceeded to bus. Noticed on way that gate was already open (if true it was open an hour as the ticket says 4:05). Got on bus which took a very long time as he got caught in some sort of jam at the end. Took at least 30 -40 minutes. Followed signs to a second security check and then checked board to find the gate had closed! Tried to explain this to the rep at the connections desk but she (and the supervisor she supposedly contacted) were adamant that the aircraft had arrived on time and I would have to pay for a new ticket (how is it on time when the gate is already open at 4:05). By my calculations it was physically impossible for me to go from area B to A in the short time the gate was remaining open. At no time did it say on the board that boarding was occurring (not that that would have mattered since I couldn't have gotten there anyway). Setting up a situation where a passenger can't physically make the connection and then making money at his expense is despicable and Dubai/Emirates have lost far more money from me than the 160 euro their scamming staff at Dubai airport swindled me out of.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | I came with my wife and our two teenage kids from Zurich with Emirates in economy class (great airplane, good service, nice overnight flight), and arrived around 6am in the morning. From the docks to the train onwards to immigration, everything worked smoothly but then, at immigration, we had to wait for maybe 40 minutes. That is a pitty, as it is a) unnecessary, and really unpleasant for any visitor (especially the elder people and the parents with little children sitting on the floor as they are simply to tired early in the morning with no breakfast). So, as Dubai and Emirates do not aim for second best in any aspect, I would expect the Dubai Airport Authoroties to consider any option that cuts the waiting time down to a short instance, with maybe 2-3 minutes waiting. That is one of the important benchmarks met not only by leading competing Airports (such as Singapor Changi) but even by more tratditional ones such as Zurich. So, as the Cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi have left us with an outstanding first impression, I do hope, and remain confident that Dubai Airport will take action and very soon turn this Chokepoint into a Swift and efficent Checkpoint as it is an industry standard.

Dubai,"✅ Trip Verified | Departure - We did the online check in before hand and arrived at the airport approximately 1 hour 50 minutes before the flight time. There was a long queue as several flights were leaving during the evening hours. It took almost 45 minutes to complete the baggage drop and to collect the boarding pass.

Dubai,"❎ Unverified | I went to Dubai Airport to pick up my wife and saw for the first time the new ticket parking machines where they have No. Plate Recognition Cameras, when I came out there was no problem paid at the machine got out easy, however when I went to drop her off at the airport and came to pay at a machine that's when I discovered that they don't give change. I had to go back into the airport to get some change, when I got back to the machine it had gone up from 20 to 30 dirhams.

The outgoing transit felt fairly rushed, the return, with over two and a half hours for the transit, was much easier. On both legs, the screening process for transit passengers was pretty quick (0800/0500).

Dubai,"Transit at Dubai airport was a disappointing experience on 2 of my last trips. I had high expectations since anyone would assume that the transit hub of Emirates would be of great quality.

Then an unexpected security check, with large queues especially on the busy hours. Prepare to spend at least an hour there, and also deal with ignorant and unfriendly staff.

The duty free shops are great, but what a traveler needs on a transit airport are basic amenities and some place to sit or rest and some clean toilets, which are hard things to find in Dubai terminal 3, unless you go to the lounges. Toilets were shockingly dirty and overcrowded, probably the worst I have ever come across in an international airport. It was also really hard to find a proper seat, even around your gate; on the contrary you would see people resting on the floor. The design of the upper floor gates space doesn't make much sense for the amount of people waiting for their flights there.

Could not see much as it was 6.25 pm or thereabouts and getting dusky. However on 14 May we checked in by 6pm although flight was at 8pm. This gave us the chance to see the departure area. There were no proper signs as to where to check in and we spent a good half hour standing in the wrong queue. I was surprised to see people sitting in groups on the floor and some even eating.

Then I realized my responsibility to public safety (and myself) and told a Dubai airport attendant (they wear the blue shirts), who informed me that security had been informed. 20 more minutes later security never showed up! You can imagine my concern as a foreign traveler. Fortunately the owner showed up. I informed the same blue-shirt attendant that the owners of the bag were now right in front of me and they just stood there staring, not attempting to inform the bag owner of their responsibilities to monitor their baggage. As for the overcrowding, you can't check into the gates until 2 hours prior to your flight and there's NO where to go except one tiny Starbucks.

Dubai,"Transit in Dubaï is becoming more and more an ugly experience, provided that with the growth of their fleet, Emirates is not docking to gates when your a note travelling on A380's.

During my last trip, Geneva - Dubai - Bangalore return, we spent between 30min to 45min in the buss. Due to short transit, rest of it was about running in the terminal to catch next plane.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review | We experienced transit, arrival and departure this month. Transit wasn't too bad as we only 2 hours there, long enough to be fleeced by the bar (£10 for a beer) and shake shack (I think it was called that, £7 for a shake). The positives were that there were some drinking water fountains in the airport, however the first one we tried dispensed warm water. Boarding was ok although as ever it's clear that Emirates do not care about their economy class passengers. 2 weeks later we arrived back at DXB for a one night stopover, the arrival was straightforward, passport control was easy and the bags were quick. However when we got to the taxi rank we were directed to a car by someone who looked like they worked there, only to be ripped off by a £40 fare to the palm. Even if the guy there wasn't an employee, any airport that cared for it's customers would stop these con artists from being at the airport. The last straw was when we departed Dubai the following day. The check in staff were the most miserable and ignorant I have encountered at any airport, likewise the passport control guy seemed to hate people, and really had no care for his job. Even with my polite ""good morning"" to anyone we encountered, responses were non-existent. Then at the gate were were subjected to further security by ignorant staff. After this there was an announcement that anyone with duty free liquid would need to speak to staff as it would not be allowed on the plane, there were no Emirates staff around and the security guards were completely disinterested, the woman at security was too busy playing with her phone to help. We were so delighted to leave Dubai and would happily never return to this dump of an airport - it may look nice but if you fill it with the worlds most ignorant staff it will never be a nice place.

With seating far inadequate to house the hundreds of passengers passing through its doors daily and a quality of bathrooms equally poor, it is surprising that this terminal can be allowed to run the way it does.

I arrive, check in and go through security expecting to be boarding roughly 15 minutes later.

Dubai,"✅ Verified Review | Dubai Airport is huge. It has to be given the number of Airbus A380s that Emirates fly to/from there. Yet somehow the departure lounge at Terminal 3 feels very overcrowded and cramped. The main walk through area is full of retail outlets, turning this into one big shopping mall. The gates are positioned to the sides and while these can be quieter, in order to find your gate you have to negotiate through the chaos. As a super-hub, it literally is where East meets West. The terminal consists of three concourses. A is on its own (connected by an underground rail system to the other concourses), while B and C are joined together. The look and feel of Concourses A and B are very similar, while Concourse C is older and much more relaxed. Footfall through A and B is far higher that through C. I personally found Concourse C nicer. It was quiet, the retail shops were on a lower lever and there were plenty of seats (plenty of sleeper seats too). My only fault with C was the dated ""hole in the floor"" toilets. Terminals A and B appear to have less seating, the queues for the toilets were ridiculously long and it all seems geared towards passengers spending money rather than passengers relaxing before/between flights. Our flight from CMB to DXB parked away from the terminal so we needed to board a bus, travel 10 minutes to Concourse A, walk inside, pass through Security, follow the signs to the rail system, take a train to Concourse B, then follow the conga line of passengers up several escalators to the main Departures area for our connecting flight.

A strange start for a review but for years I have been traveling thru Terminal 1 and had such high expectations for the finish of Terminal 3.

The opulence of design is there, has fantastic choices for restaurants, has a massive amount of shopping available and even smoking lounges for those so inclined. However they took a fantastic concept design with wide open hallways for moving people from place to place then: 1) Dropped a shopping mall in the middle - you cannot get from place to place quickly as you are dodging all the retail customers browsing the shelves. 2) Added retail kiosks to the already congested walkways. 3) Poor signage if you have to transition to another terminal upon arrival. Get ready to be lost first time travelers of Terminal 3. 4) No fast transit to Terminal 1, I had to assist a very elderly lady myself to ensure she made the 20 min walk to her new gate after she got off my flight. 5) Limited Washrooms - don't leave it to the last minute here folks as they are hard to find and normally have a lineup when you do eventually get there.

Dubai,"Arrived in Terminal 1 on a busy Thursday night, with plenty of long-haul arrivals from the Far East and Europe, two Saudi Arabia flights, a full Boeing 777-300ER from Doha (my flight), plus the usual India/Pakistan flights. It was very busy, with thousands of passengers walking towards passport control via the underground tunnel. Passport control was a huge mess, which has been the case for several years now. There are 2 different types of queues-a few for 'GCC Nationals', and 'Other Nationalities.' Given that 90% of the population are not GCC citizens, not a very efficient allocation of resources. Lumping the 'others' together is big mistake, as there are no lines for UAE Residents (who are fastest to process), UAE visitors, and those entering for work/residence (each category needs to be processed differently). Ridiculous thing is, lines for E-Gate were very, very long. Having just a few machines may have worked back in 2003 when only a few savvy frequent travellers signed up for them, but the reality is any Dubai resident 18 and above who travels more than twice a year probably has E-gate now.

Saw a Lebanese family (mother had E-gate but husband and infant did not) try to go through the adjacent immigration booth, but were rudely turned away by the officer and told to join the back of the very long regular queues. As a courtesy E-gate card holders' dependents are usually let through. Very impolite and shows how there is no system in place for young/elderly/infirm travellers. This is in contrast to Terminal 3, where there is Smart Gate, and E-Gate, and dedicated lines for UAE residents. Baggage claim hall was very busy and no monitors displaying which flight was assigned to which belt. T1's chaos has become normal and management seems somewhat complacent.

Dubai,I had great expectations for this airport which were not met. We flew in from Paris in business class on Emirates on an A380 and departed on Singapore Airlines also in business. Arrived around midnight and it took us about 1 hour to get to our chauffeur. Lines were long and staff did not appear to be in a hurry. Luggage still had not arrived by the time we cleared immigration. Only positive is that Terminal 3 is new and clean. By contrast Terminal 1 is old and not well lit. There is no express line for business class passengers and at 5.00pm the lines were long. Again the staff were in no hurry. From the time we arrived took over an hour to get to the Lufthansa lounge which Singapore Airlines used.

Dubai,"We landed in a remote parking bay after a 10 hour long haul flight. The bus ride to the terminal took 25 min. The bus dropped us in a secondary screening area that seemed infrequently used. After exiting we had to make a choice as to which terminal to go to B or C. Despite waiting for the tv screens to cycle through multiple screens, because our transit waiting time (4 hours) was longer than the number of flights they could display, they did not indicate which way we should walk. Although well advertised the stroller facility was empty. We had two toddlers so wanted to be sure we walked to the correct terminal. We then tried the interactive kiosk, but it also did not have our connecting flight details. We then tried to find a staff member - unlike other airports they are hard to locate at the transit connections point. When we did the advice was ""sit on the floor and wait an hour until the details are available - as there were no chairs."" We eventually flipped a coin and went one way. We were flying business class and went to the lounge. There were long queues for the men's toilets on the lounge and the facilities were dirty despite there being a person there to arrange the towels. In an odd choice of spatial planning, the kids play area in the lounge in only accessible by walking through the smoking lounge.

I arrived back from our Christmas holiday in the UK via Heathrow (which incidentally was great) to experience a 2 hour queue for immigration on arrival at Dubai Airport's Terminal 1. Unable to use the e gate facility as we had a 3 year old with us, we had to stand and watch the relatively chaotic queue management system cope with the hordes of arriving passengers. I accept that this may have been one of the busiest periods for the airport but what was difficult to fathom was the lack of any other processing facilities for those of us who are resident in the country outside of e gates. There was only one man in a military uniform who seemed to be involved in queue management and there were so many people around no one could make out what he was saying.

Dubai,"We flew to Dubai on our way to Abu Dhabi and I was quite excited to see Dubai airport, after all the episodes that I saw of Ultimate Airports. To begin with, it is very huge and spans acres. The three elongated concourses see multiple airlines from across the world vying for a gate. Unfortunately, our Emirates flight arrived late at Dubai airport and was allocated a remote gate at the far end of the airport. The bus ride from the aircraft to the main terminal, zig-zagging through internal roads took us almost 15 minutes. The immigration clearance was quite smooth, but the officers seemed to be enjoying chatting amongst themselves. What really set the temperatures soaring was the amount of time the luggage took to come to the conveyor belt. We werent actually surprised, since we ourselves took some time to reach the terminal. Thanks to all this mess, we ended up missing our connecting bus to Abu Dhabi. While departing Dubai airport, since we ended up arriving quite early (and had checked in online) we had an ample time to loiter around. The formalities took us not more than 30 minutes and we were off to explore Concourse B of Terminal 3. The duty free shopping is something to look out for. The terminal itself is very big and walking through all the gates will give you a good exercise before boarding the flight. The boarding happens at the lower floor than the main departures floor.

Doha,"✅ Trip Verified | Arriving from Bangkok en route to the UK, I assumed that the airport procedures would be as simple as usual. Not on this occasion. I was on an A380 business class from BKK which had arrived at a gate. Not far was a lit red sign 'Transit' about half way along a travelator, we walked to it, only to be told that we had to walk further. The next two signs also indicated transit doors which were closed. So we then had to walk around 400 meters until there was a transit gate open. Security checks were very strict (good point) and you then take an escalator down into the Duty Free area. The problem here is that within about 10 meters of the foot of the escalator is large outward flight display. With many dozens looking for their onward flight gates, they blocked the very narrow passageway. So I had to walk through Duty Free to try to find the lounge and the location of my next gate. If I recall correctly that was C14 - but there were no indicators anywhere showing where C14 could be located. So I started a very long journey around the new additions to the airport attempting to find the Qatar lounge. Two staff I spoke to gave wrong or misleading directions.

Doha,I flew from YYZ to AMD via Doha (old airport). Overall experience is not so bad except transporting to plane by coach. Embarking from and boarding to plane is by coach but overall management of coaches are good. Security check is quite fast and not so much hold up. Security personal are not checking for liquid in your hand baggage and line moves really nicely. This is for transfer and not sure about passenger boarding from Doha. Airport terminal is quite clean and roomy. Good part is there is a nice play area for young kids and reasonably good quality free WiFi. Washroom are no so clean mainly due to culture of people using them and mostly wet. In rush hours it is crawded and also sometime close one in middle due to close off that area (US bond flights).

No assistance or clear information regarding a fast lane at the immigration hall. Immigration officer was very rude and made us go to another counter at the other end of the immigration hall.

Doha,Very sad airport. There seems to be plenty of toilet cleaners but the toilets are crowded not so clean and far too few in numbers. The business class lounge is the worst I have seen. The options for eating are severely limited Costas and one other similar place. Not very exciting for a delay of several hours. The single runway means every plane is going to be late. The runway just cannot handle the number of flights and then the terminal cannot handle the number of passengers. We waited one hour to land circled at 15000 feet and then later for the next flight sat on the tarmac all ready to go for 70 minutes before actually taking off. The staff are amiable but unhelpful.

Doha,"Disabled assistance at Doha airport is incredibly chaotic and inefficient. I have vowed never to fly Qatar Airways again after this. Upon arrival my disabled husband and I were herded into a ""special area"". Our passports were taken off us. About 15 mins before our flight was to depart I began to panic and make a fuss (otherwise we weren't going anywhere). They finally loaded us and another disabled passenger onto a special bus to take us to the plane. About 5 mins on the other passengers noticed that they had left her bag with her passport/boarding pass behind so we had to go back. Finally with all bags we get to the plane and the flight has been closed they had to radio for permission from the pilot to reopen the door to let us on.

Doha,Whilst I agree about the time taken to get to the plane by bus I felt that I should add my recent experience of Doha International Airport to redress the balance somewhat. I found it to be a smooth trouble free experience. It took approx 25 minutes from the time that we left our hotel in Doha to the time we were sitting at the gate waiting for our plane to be called (admittedly this was at midnight).

We were in transit and after a long bus ride in (nearly 20 mins) from the plane there was a long queue to clear security where despite being on the colour coded short transfer queue we found the world and his wife going through the supposedly quick short transfer queue to avoid the long queue in ordinary transfer queue. None of the airport staff seemed to care so what's the point ? As a result we only just made our transfer time and then had another 19 minute bus ride out to the next plane (I timed it).

We were traveling in Business on Qatar and the Business lounge wasn't very good compared to other countries. It's very over rated and as a seasoned traveler I was very disappointed with the lack of 24 hour service I have had in Asian airports.

Doha,Connected from Bangkok to Cairo and back. First experience in Doha. The colour system they have for various passengers is great (yellow tags and cards for transfers Orange for quick transfers etc.). The terminal itself is just a glass box (I expected a larger venue) but functioned well. Clean with a couple of shops here and there but I believe the new airport is to open soon and would reflect Qatar's ambition to offer a world class airport. This one works but lets say it lacks any lustre for me its a non issue as long as all worked fine. The internet is free and appreciated even though works only on one side of the terminal and closer to gate 20 21 22 the signal is barely there and connection almost impossible. Staff are polite especially in the x-ray checks (which is a big issue for me especially in other Middle eastern airports). The only negative point is the people jammed downstairs when boarding the bus.

Doha,Transited here twice during November 2013. As others have pointed out the bus transfers from the plan are the longest I have ever come across - and there is the inevitable confusion for some passengers between the Doha arrival and transit/departures stop which can cause some chaos. Overall the airport terminal for transit was not as bad as I feared - plenty of seats in the downstairs area and a nice coffee shop close to the toilets. However buying anything from duty free is a slow process - I tried to buy a bottle of water and had to wait nearly 10 minutes while the cashier filled out volumes of paperwork for another customer who was just buying one bottle of whisky. And after all the drama the passenger left his boarding card behind! Its bearable as a transit stop - but the sooner the new Doha airport opens the better.

Doha,Perhaps I've been lucky with the immigration queues but I've found immigration in and out of Doha to be fairly quick and straightforward - though make sure you have a credit card to cover the visa fee; they don't take cash. But I wouldn't want to be a transit passenger here; there aren't enough seats the air side food options are dismal there's hardly anywhere to plug in electronic equipment and the shopping is surprisingly poor; if I was in transit for more than a couple of hours I'd seriously consider paying for Oryx Lounge access (and maybe that's the intention). That every flight I've taken to and from Doha seems to involve a long bus drive from the gate to and from the actual plane is also a minus - and often confusing to people who haven't used the airport before.

Doha,I found arrival with Qatar Airways excellent customs was fast and for the region ok in friendliness. Visa upon arrival possible by credit card and directly at customs check though depending on nationality I guess. Taxis wait outside just around the corner. I found especially departure in the main terminal disturbing for Qatar-standards. I must again admit that check-in customs and security-checks went smooth and fast however that is it. There are few shops that basically all sell the same tax-free items if not coffee. Most disappointing was the food court and choice it was probably amongst some of the poorest I ever seen after travelling to quite some airports in different parts of the world. There are hardly tables available and half of them is reserved for airport and airline staff of which some noisy as well. Ordering service was chaotic and food quality was below average. Also the fact bus transport is used for every flight where you would have expected air-conditioned walking bridges in Qatar instead is a very annoying thing and may indeed take a while to reach the airplane.

Doha,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have been in. Mainly due to the archaic use of busses that take over 20 minutes to get to and from the aircraft to the terminal. And then when checking in with the extremely polite staff everyone must hurdle into a 2nd waiting room to wait for the bus. The lack of services at the airport are very poor. 2 or 3 restrooms tops that have a line out the door for men are packed and in locations not convenient to all passenger waiting areas. Since the current airport is so small the food and shopping options are extremely limited and the shopping is limited to duty free items (and over-priced electronics).

Doha,This airport desperate for an upgrade. The big fancy new Doha airport has had its opening delayed for several years and it shows as Qatar Airlines continues to expand its massive fleet despite the tiny overwhelmed airport that serves as its transit hub. A few problems to note: 1) The bathrooms would be a disgrace for even a small regional airport let alone a global hub. You would be forgiven for thinking the bathroom line is for boarding a plane because it stretches across the halls. Once you reach the inside there are more sinks than toilets. 2) During peak hours people are camped out all over the floors due to the lack of seats.

We have no problems to find seats while waiting in transit however the toilets area I have seen better in other airports. The main issue for us is how long time it takes to go by bus from the aircraft to the airport. Our experience is from 10 to 25 minutes which is long time when the departure time is 45 minutes.

Doha,Transiting to/from LHR and HKG. The airport is clearly in transition as the opening of NDIA approaches. The terminal is still massively overcrowded even at 0300 but it's quite easy to find a seat as seats are everywhere. The new colour-coded transfer card system works well and clearing security only takes a few minutes even when several wide-body aircraft arrive at the same time. Staff are friendly and helpful with no hassle at security. Toilets rarely stay clean for long – the cleaners work very hard but they simply can't cope with the huge volume of pax. Shops are still cheap compared to other airports especially for bottled water. The biggest issue is probably the bus ride to/from the aircraft – this must surely now be the world's longest aircraft-to-terminal bus ride – the distances are huge!

Doha,We had about an hour between flights at Doha (RGN-DOH-LHR). On arrival we spent many minutes cruising round the edge of the airport in a transfer bus eventually got to the transfer gate the fast transfer lanes were closed but no queue at all at normal-speed lanes so no problem. Arrived at departure gate as it was due to open admired once again the confusing way a flight disappears from the gates display screen list as soon as the gate is opened. Our flight was delayed so we hung around for half an hour. They don't make announcements about delays over the PA because it is a 'quiet airport' (no-one told the lady who was using the PA to tell us not to smoke). Suddenly the gate was open we moved forward but great efforts were made to persuade us to sit down again to avoid an unsightly queue but we resolutely kept standing and submitted ourselves to the first of 3 back to back ID checks. Got to the gate itself (check number two) and down an escalator to a tatty ground floor area waiting for access to the transit bus two of which were parked by the doors. The escalator continued to bring more and more people down from upstairs. Still no exit was allowed to the bus. A man struggled through the crowd with a key. It didn't fit the door lock. The escalator had been turned off by now to stop people tripping over each other at the bottom. The man tried the other door. An ironic cheer went up as the door opened. Time for our third ID check and on to the bus which then didn't leave for a few minutes even though it was obvious more the one bus would be needed. We set off on another extended tour of the airport perimeter and arrived at the foot of the aircraft's steps. Naturally only the rear door was available to us Economy class passengers so boarding was slow. All in all not a brilliant experience.

No special/fast track counter desk for transfer passengers with only an hour allowance and who have to be assisted very quickly for an immediate transfer.

Doha,Great airline but what a shambles at Doha it is not a pleasant experience. Flew MAN-DOH-KUL with 1.5 hrs change time outbound and 1hr 45mins return. All transfers appear to be by bus but this is very poor. The ground staff have a completely lackadaisical attitude it is 15 minutes before you can disembark then a wait on the bus while the driver chats with his mates. Elementary things like vans being parked on the bus ways delay you even further on what feels like several km from plane to terminal. We only went through security on the return journey for some reason and there were long snaking queues but the actually processing was OK. When you get to the departure hall it is not too bad with some nice outlets like Costa that take cards for small amounts for no surcharge. Not that you will get time to use them as they are calling flights for ‘immediate boarding’ 50 mins before time. None of this was in any way relaxing given the ridiculously short transfer times booked by Qatar Airlines; one party we met had been allowed 31 minutes.

Doha,The original terminal which I used to pass through frequently in the 1990’s seems to have disappeared to be replaced with a larger more modern building which is only a temporary terminal pending opening of the new Doha Airport. There are no airbridges so passengers are bussed to and from the terminal. Many connecting flights have short transfer times (mine was 50 minutes) which considering the time needed to travel to and from the terminal makes for a rushed and somewhat stressful transfer experience. I had been given an orange and yellow trimmed ‘short transfer’ boarding pass on check in with instructions from Qatar Airways to make this visible on arrival at Doha and to follow instructions. As it turned out no one was interested and there were no ‘short transfer’ lanes open or anyone offering assistance. Fortunately it was easy enough to identify my departure gate which was only a short walk away. The terminal itself is rather basic and functional and still too small for the number of passengers using it but easy to navigate and seems to do its job effectively enough.

Doha,Travelled through this airport twice last month and overall impression was that it is below average. The biggest problem is that there are no airbridges onto the plane so in order to board the aircraft you go down an escalator into a very cramped 'holding area' with hardly any seats before boarding a bus for the very long journey out to the plane. Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge.

Doha,My only experience of transiting DOH in the past was as a J class passenger and having read the reviews of the airport for transiting 'down the back' I did wonder if I had done the right thing. The flight was an hour early and there transit terminal security check was deserted so there were no bad experiences and I was soon walking around the duty free shops. Cost of food in the food outlets seemed OTT but there is nothing new in that concept! Boarding for the onward connection was orderly although making everyone use the rear steps for boarding was a pain especially as the other steps wouldn't have disturbed the J class passengers (who in fact hadn't boarded anyway).

Doha,Generally it is a transit/transfer airport. Compared to many other airports it is standard during peak hours you hardly can move freely in the airport. The duty free is small with limited items available. For such a transit terminal it is not entertaining/accommodating enough. The toilets need improvement but still adequate. No trolleys available so you need to carry all of your cabin luggage when shopping in the duty free and the queue of the payment point could be a nightmare.

Doha,I live in Doha and use the airport frequently. The most common problem is the lack of seating or space for travellers. The departure queues are the least efficient but customer service is great at the counter. The problem we have experienced is knowing where to go for the check-in process but staff are very hands-on and get travellers in the right queue. Signage could be better. I never experienced any issues through security and immigration staff are wonderful. The food places located in the terminal are usually very busy with a lack of seats and there are lines for food. The currency exchange booth is generally busy. The baggage return is hot and cold. When I returned from Egypt we waited over an hour for the bags to be distributed. After an hour I went to the baggage office and complained because incoming flights after ours had received their bags. After I complained bags started to be distributed one-at-a-time.

We arrived at Doha to wait in long queues - they did however move quickly. The transfer to the terminal was very long on the 2nd leg. The transfer to the plane on the 1st leg was terrible (all shoved into a very small waiting room) and after about 20min doors were opened to allow us onto the buses - which we waited in with closed doors when we got to the plane. What is the point of a smoking room if everyone stands inside with the door open? Duty Free badly laid out on the one side - during peak times you cant move - a very strange mix of products.

Doha,Brief transfer en route Heathrow-Male around four hours to kill on return journey. Outbound involved boarding a bus on the far side round the perimeter road through security - seemed a bit cursory - upstairs to departure gate straight back downstairs onto bus and straight back to far side to join second plane. Easy to pass time on return plenty of seats and a great view of takeoffs and landings. This time the flights arrived and left from the terminal side.

Doha,After reading reviews here we were slightly concerned even though it was only a 2 hour stop over. We need not have worried at all. Security was quick and easy with efficient staff who pointed us in the correct direction for transit. After our flight from LHR we wanted to freshen up and found the toilets very clean with large cubicles and plenty of paper towels. Duty free was expensive but there is a smaller shop on the 1st floor were you could buy small gifts books papers soft drinksetc at good prices. Next door was a Costa Coffee and we enjoyed a nice coffee for a similar price to Europe so we had no argument there. Didn't use the food court area but it looked okay nothing fancy and not much choice but was serving it's purpose. All in all it was an okay small airport which was very clean and comfortable my only one annoyance was the gentleman on our boarding gate who stopped nearly every non-white person who passed to check their details. He was so rude and patronising to a British born Indian lady in front of us it was embarrassing for her. Thankfully she kept her cool and dignity which showed him up.

Doha,Transiting to/from HKG. Huge queues at security due to constant landing of widebody aircraft but it never took longer than 15 minutes to clear security as plenty of staff and scanners are available. Never imagined an airport could be so crowded at 2am. The terminal is too small considering how busy this airport is becoming but this has the benefit that all the gates can be reached 2-3 minutes after security. Passports are only checked at the boarding gates. Facilities are limited (ground floor duty free area a few restaurants and small shops upstairs) so a long layover would be dull but enough for a 2-3 hour wait. Plenty of seats everywhere. Toilets inadequate - the cleaners do try but can't seem to keep up due to the volume of pax. No air bridges so a long bus journey to/from the plane seems usual.

Doha,Doha airport is on the small side for the numbers of flights Qatar are running. I arrived from Manchester on route to Bangkok early evening to the usual long lines at security - which to be fair do seem to quite efficient. Main terminal is compact to say the least lower floor crowded duty free area badly set out almost impossible to walk around at time without knocking something off the displays with your bags - long queues to pay I gave up and went to the second floor which is much better with plenty of seats. As I had an eight and a half hour stopover on both outwards and return flights I pre-booked into the Onyx lounge - this is situated on the second floor and quite nice - quiet with plenty of seats a small internet corner. In the main area there are TVs newspapers and magazines but only of local interest. A small food area is nicely set out selection of food a little disappointing although its plentiful you can help yourself to tea coffee and soft drinks as often as you want. The cost in $40.00 but if you are only in Doha for a short time its not worth paying .

Childrens play area was closed and looked in a bad state of repair. Toilets in sufficient supply but not very inviting. Boarding announcements nonstop and very loud - airport was cold buses were even colder. Bus ride and waiting time at the aircraft was unbearable on both trips. On the return leg we remained 35 minutes in front of the aircraft before being allowed onboard. As a result we saw the baggage handlers for our flight throwing violently all suitcases on the tarmac prior to loading - not what you would expect. Transfer and security were efficient.

Doha,Arrived at 18.30 from Manchester to connect with a flight to Dubai. Like many others we were on a remote stand and a bus journey longer than average. However it did mean that you were dropped right by the Immigration desks and transit section. So you didn't have to walk far. Transit processing very quick and I was in the departure lounge 5 minutes after getting off the bus. Doha Airport is small which means that all the departure gates are within the same area - no walking miles. Duty free shop small size good choice of usual items but a bit chaotic due to lots of people. Prices same as other international airports. The food court was small and also chaotic - food below average so dont rely on this! Nowhere to get a beer. My lay over was only 80 minutes but this soon passed as boarding for my onward flight started 50 minutes early due to the plane being on a remote stand.

My one criticism (and I do realise Qatar is a Muslim country) Doha is an International airport and needs a good 'sit down' restaurant (not a take-away) and a bar for travellers.

Doha,"I got here early as I thought my Amex Card gave me access to a lounge however only Amex issued in the Middle East can have access so found myself with 2 hours of walking round. When I arrived the queue for the baggage screening was short so was straight in checkin was fast immigration was not so fast and final security check was okay as the immigration lines were throttling the amount of people trying to get through. Once inside you go straight into the duty free area of which there were plenty of cigarettes but everything else seemed to be lacking for example the only decent champagne was a '98 Dom Perignon everything else was Moet or less. To be honest they did have everything you could want i.e. electronics Mont Blanc Hugo Boss etc but the range they had of each was limited and expensive compared to UK High Street prices. There were a few shops on the upper level but the main shopping was a large single shop on the lower level. Food was also limited no restaurants just 2 food courts at separate ends of the terminal both were very busy until gone midnight then they were almost deserted. Opposite the far food court was a small childrens play area. One thing you could find plenty of was toilets and smoking rooms however some of these are 'hidden' so most people crammed into the smaller easily accessible rooms whereas the larger rooms were empty. At the far end of the terminal were a mosque and next to it a quiet room. The quiet room has very comfy chairs but none were free so a few people were sleeping in the mosque despite the sign ""No sleeping in the mosque"".

People have been so tired of your airport and Etihad for offering service like this. Old Terminal, Terminal and facilities start to feel like 50 years ago and this is not a year like this? It’s already 2020 and you and Etihad cannot handle customers complaints and opinions on your own airport and airline. The lounge in Terminal 3 of Etihad is still good, but Terminal 1 is awful. Compared to other airports worldwide including New Istanbul Airport (TK), Changi Singapore (SQ) and most other major airports WW including Dubai (EK). Why can’t Abu Dhabi Airport do better than these airports now? What’s the problem with your new terminal delayed? And worst, Etihad service is worse than major airlines as well.

Abu Dhabi,"❌ Not Verified | As a 22 year old college grad who has spent the past few years living in squalor, my expectations for air travel aren't very high. That being said, I'm pretty disappointed with Abu Dhabi's airport. Before I begin, it's worth noting that I'm writing this in the midst of a 8 hour layover, which probably isn't helping my mood. A few of the other reviews complained about the humidity, which personally I don't have an issue with - the facility is well enough conditioned to avoid heat stroke. To make things simple, I'll list pros and cons from my experience today. Pros: Good wifi. The massage I got was actually pretty decent. Fast queue times (just kidding, I still have a few hours before I find out if that happens for sure). Cons: 45 minute massage cost 105 USD. Very average ramen noodle + beef cost 17 USD. Poor airport design (I've had easier times navigating labyrinths). The tables in the smoking lounge are falling apart. Cigarettes only available by the carton. No alcohol in the daytime (to be fair, this was due to a religious holiday). The employees aren't very helpful, I was looking for the sleeping pods that were advertised on the website, after walking around for 30-40 minutes with several employees pointing me in several different directions, I eventually discovered that the sleeping pods were no longer in the airport. Tips to Abu Dhabi: Give each traveler a map + crayon when they get off their flight. Lower your food prices or hire flame jugglers to entertain me while I eat your sub par noodles.

Abu Dhabi,"❎ Not Verified | Very unhelpful. It was 2 am and one of my kids was asleep and they kicked us out of the seating area, lined everyone up to check their tickets.

The man checking tickets saw me struggling with my sleeping child and had me sit him in the original seating area apologizing saying people with kids don’t have to wait in line. However he did nothing to warn the other parents. So we went down the line telling all the parents ourselves. The ticket man also said to sit near the entrance as they would announce people with kids to board. When the time came they boarded wheelchair users and let economy riders on at the same time as business class (who were very upset). I confronted a stewardess asking why they haven’t announced business class or people with kids. She just said your in the kids line, look their are lots of you. I wasn’t in a line really I was standing with business class and a few people with kids. I saw another attendant and asked him. He suggested we all sit down.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Trip Verified | It does not compare to Dubai, a place of such efficiency, it would be very difficult to beat. My concern about this airport is the heavy presence of unlicensed and illegal taxi touts. A year ago these individuals were clustered at the doorways. Now, imbued with a sense of complete freedom from action from any officials, they are right inside and no more than five paces after you step out from Customs. There was one fraught security official who professed he could not manage the crowd of around 25 of these men. Anyone slightly western looking is pounced on. I asked to see a permit. They could not provide. They quote outrageous prices thinking you will be ignorant of the real rates. What did shift some of them? I got out the camera and took a few pictures. They ran but two minutes later they were back. Then they decided to locate up at the other exit. There was one empty police car. No officers. I did try to locate them unsuccessfully. There are no warning posters anywhere. Nobody gives you a leaflet inside the Arrivals Hall that provides correct information. There is not enough security and even Customer Services say they cannot deal with it. So this 'mafia' operate with impunity. Down in Dubai there are police and they arrest and deport that day these taxi touts, many of whom are not legally in the country anyway.

Baby cars were readily available and greatly helped me in getting the little one where she needed to be with minimal fuss. The security queue was quickly bypassed when the staff noticed I was travelling with a child. In any case the queue was not long. Both times on arrival I ended up on a bus to get to the terminal but each time the journey was about 3 mins. The bus was waiting when we arrived and wasted no time in leaving when full. I would not consider getting a bus to the terminal to be a negative point. The toilets were clean enough and I didn't have any queue to use them.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review | Had to transit through Abu Dhabi on my way to Sydney from London. I wasn't particularly happy coming off the Etihad flight due to the lack of legroom and the airport didn't help my mood. For a hub airport it felt very small, although in terms of airport land occupancy it dwarves Heathrow. There aren't many shops nor too many places to eat but the biggest problem is the toilets. On my return journey one of the toilet/shower rooms was closed so I had to go and find another. One other I tried was queuing out the door (for a mens toilet this is rare), so I walked for a few more minutes and found another and waited in a shorter queue. However when I left there was a queue out the door. The cleanliness wasn't any good either even though there was a cleaner in them constantly cleaning the floor (why?). But with a wet floor making the room feel like a sauna with a damp smell and the toilet seats just being a mess. Not a pleasant experience. Taxi time in the airport seemed to take too long as well, especially as there didn't seem to be much air traffic. Meanwhile Heathrow the far far busier airport has plenty of shops, more seating areas, more and much cleaner toilets.

Abu Dhabi,"✅ Verified Review | I was transiting at Abu Dhabi on my way from London Heathrow to Jakarta. At first glance, the airport is incredibly busy, however as many passengers flying through Abu Dhabi are also transiting, I had expected the crowd. What does amazes me though, for an airport serving a five star airline and the national airline of the United Arab Emirates was the fact that they could not be bothered to provide enough and adequate toilets for passengers. I had to go through the entire length of the terminal to find a toilet with a short enough line that I would not miss my connecting flight. Even the short line cost me 25 minutes of waiting. The toilet itself was not that clean and definitely not up to the standard neighbouring Dubai has. Shops and seating are available in great numbers but due to the crowd, full. Also, for an airport this size and a five star airline, I did not expect to board my flight to Jakarta through bus transfer in the middle of the day in 45*C weather. It was like being in a sauna. For me, Dubai International is a much better alternative and considering the decline in quality and service of Etihad Airways, I think flying with Emirates via Dubai is the best alternative from here on then. You would be able to find plenty of clean and queue free toilets in Dubai and hop on to your flight through a sophisticated system called a ""gate"".",6.0,0,Solo Leisure,Transit,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2017.0,verified review transiting abu dhabi way london heathrow jakarta first glance airport incredibly busy however many passengers flying abu dhabi also transiting expected crowd amazes though airport serving five star airline national airline united arab emirates fact could bothered provide enough adequate toilets passengers go entire length terminal find toilet short enough line would miss connecting flight even short line cost minutes waiting toilet clean definitely standard neighbouring dubai shops seating available great numbers due crowd full also airport size five star airline expect board flight jakarta bus transfer middle day c weather like sauna dubai international much better alternative considering decline quality service etihad airways think flying emirates via dubai best alternative would able find plenty clean queue free toilets dubai hop flight sophisticated system called gate,0.9858,Positive,Global Transit Hub

Staff were really disinterested and seemed untrained at times, once through after 15 minutes again signage is confusing and then you are met with so much overcrowding its unbelievable! People sitting anywhere they could as there were not enough seats. Toilets are a disgrace so if you can hold until you board the plane then do so.

Unfortunately, we had to endure 10 hours at this airport. Allow me to point out the good things first. Good things: - the experience in the shuttle bus that drove us from the airplane to the airport was good 'the driver was kind enough to turn on the a/c in the bus despite us being the only ones onboard' - (we were the last ones to disembark the plane). The staff in the food court/village explained patiently what we could get with the meal vouchers issued to us (it wasn't true that you could have any meal as the issuer of the vouchers claimed) - when they changed the boarding gate a few minutes before the scheduled boarding time, we appreciated the person going around the gate to make sure that passengers had transferred to the correct gate. Bad things: - there is no co-ordination between departments - most staff we encountered were apathetic and rude: change of flight counter, person manning the queue in the x-ray area before the boarding gates, ground crew who was wearing a vest with reflective tapes and boarded passengers (that was a first actually because in my years of travelling I have never encountered a ground crew getting our passports and boarding passengers). They were late in boarding passengers because the plane was parked at the wrong gate. Instead of practicing the standard procedure (of asking business class passengers, passengers with kids and seniors to board first), they just ""motioned"" to the passengers to line, they did not even announce it so we were surprised that people far from us got into the line first (when we were already beside the gate).

Abu Dhabi,"Transiting through AUH is an ordeal, and lets down the very good inflight product of its dominant hub carrier Etihad. Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd.

Abu Dhabi,"I've lost count the amount of times I've traveled in and out of this airport, but I have been to all 3 terminals to review them here. Terminal 1: This is where all the other airlines (not low cost) flies out to and out from. Small considering its Abu Dhabi, where all the money is at. You are required to scan your luggage prior to check in and 'apparently' only passengers are allowed to go there, even if you're just there to buy flight tickets which is located inside. Only one small coffee shop before the immigration check for you to hang with your loved ones before you say goodbye. Inside the terminal past security, only few stores available, and all are tiny. Terminal 2: This is where the low costs airlines such as Rotana Jet flies in or out from. Terminal is tiny, looks like a ghost town with only one coffee shop that surprisingly has good food. Coming in to the terminal was another nightmare. I've flown in twice here and both times were jam packed. It's as if the queue is never ending. Terminal 3: This is where all the Etihad flights come in and out from. Much better than the other 2 terminals and you can actually check in at the counter with another person accompanying you. Shops inside the terminal passed immigration is better than Terminal 1, although still not as amazing as Dubai Terminal 3 or Doha airport. Still, not recommended for transit more than 3 hours.

It didn't take that long to get through passport control even with a brief spell of getting lost and confused and also a stop off at the toilet - (although I do agree there may not be enough toilets) - Yes there was a queue at immigration but it didn't seem burdensomely long (probably about eight people in front of me). The official was polite and smiled. I was processed relatively quickly as indeed was everyone else. My rucksack came reasonably quickly on the carousel even though I was one of the last people to join the carousel. My vehicle transfer didn't show up.

Toilets are full and are also dirty. People lie on the floor blocking the passageway while restaurants are all occupied there are no place to sit either.

I'm a very frequent (business) traveller for over 30 years all over the world but Abu Dhabi ranks as one of the worst airports I have had to cross. The infrastructure cannot handle the massive inflow of passengers but the worst is that for some reason they 'forgot' to install a sufficient number of toilets. I have never experienced not even in the most remote airports such a lack of toilet facilities. In the premium lounge there were a 'total' of 4 toilets for men resulting in waiting lines of 10-12 people.

Abu Dhabi,Terrible airport! For a growing carrier like Etihad and the traffic growth all around the gulf Abu Dhabi seems to be lagging behind everyone else. In terminal 3 there are 6 bag drop desks for most of the Etihad fleet (that's over 100 a/c) and around 10 normal check in desks. Average queue time can be anything from 10mins to 1hr plus. Then all the passengers move across to boarder control where of course it is chaos again. Finally when you clear immigration and security you are presented with a terrible selection of shops restaurants and cafes and no seating what so ever (unless of course you don't mind sitting on the floor or the edge of a flower bed). Then when your flight is ready to board there is a single file queue to one maybe two people checking passports. So the queue here for a B777 or A340 is 15mins+. Then you board the a/c and you are away. From the moment you enter the airport to boarding the plane it is a nightmare. I hope the new midfield terminal will be better. I cannot imagine what the A380 with 450-500 passengers is going to look like in terminal 3! I really feel sorry for those passengers. The staff are very rude and not interested in the passenger experience and queuing for security is chaos as staff are shouting almost every world city for passengers to skip the queue for imminent departures so the flow of people in the queue is limited as people skip the queue.

After a while the driver emerges switches the A/C on and drives forever past building sites and runways driving driving at one stage right next to the taxiway so it looks like we'll be clipped by a taxiing B747 driving driving until finally he stops at a rubbish tip.

Gate 53 turns out to be in the ""new"" part of the airport. After a lot of more walking you find gate 53 in time for the boarding call.

Abu Dhabi,"I was recently flying from BLR to ORD with a connecting flight at AUH. I expected my stopover at AUH to be pleasant. The experience was far from it. First of all directions to gates were not clear especially if you are not aware that your gate might be in a different terminal than your flight actually departs from. In my case my Etihad flight departed from the apron in front of Terminal 3 but my departure gate was Gate 8 in Terminal 1. When I got to Gate 8 (a very long walk from my arrival at the far end of Terminal 3) it was closed with nobody manning it and without any sort of notice. It turned out that the security screening for several gates was being channelled through a single line entering through a different gate although nobody was being told about it. The security screening process was slow. Once past the security process I had 2 hours to my connecting flight. Sadly there were no restaurants coffee shops or even snack counters in the departure area which had far less seating than one would expect for 777 flights. Even more sadly there wasn't a single water fountain or even a soda vending machine to quench one's thirst. For about 8 departure gates (all shuttle gates not aerobridges) there was only one toilet for females and one for males potentially having to serve a couple thousand waiting passengers. I noticed that the area had been updated with a big-screen TV lounge area and LED lighting but somehow the thought of providing adequate toilet and refreshment facilities doesn't seem to have occurred to the authorities. I didn't experience the other parts of the airport which are supposed to be quite impressive but nonetheless there is no reason such a sub-par section should exist in the international airport of such a wealthy country especially when it is part of the terminal dedicated to the flagship carrier of Abu Dhabi. One final word about Etihad. I flew economy class (""Coral"") and I did not find their service to be significantly better than say British Airways or Lufthansa.

Abu Dhabi,Just returned from holiday which involved transiting at AUH. The boarding process at Terminal 3 is to say the least chaotic. Especially if your flight involves being bussed from the terminal to where your plane is parked and because of this (notwithstanding the tight connection times between a lot of Etihad flights) they never seem to leave on time. Facilities do leave a lot to be desired.

Abu Dhabi,Absolutely ghastly airport - the worst I have visited bar none. None of my flights left on time with a minimum of 90 minutes delay - so other connections were missed. What is the point of having an exclusive Etihad Terminal 3 if you are always dropped off at Terminal 1 - especially since there is no information that you're actually in another Terminal. That's after a convoluted bus ride of at least 20 minutes. So many flights taking off mine - due to take off in 80 minutes - couldn't fit on the board so we were left to wander like the undead looking for information. The security queues were horrendous all 4 times with no organisation and plenty of attitude from ground staff. Took 2 hours to clear that on separate transfers. No obvious sign as business class that there was a separate queue for us and first though you wouldn't have been able to get through the throng of people lining up almost to Terminal 1. The lounge was heaving and unimpressive. The only thing I liked in Terminal 3 was the air- con that others dislike as by that point I was extremely hot from the stuffy overcrowded tunnel.

Abu Dhabi,Abu Dhabi terminal 3 departure area is no bigger than a small shopping centre and does not have sufficient seating or toilet facilities for the hundreds of passengers who pass through and in the case of a recent flight which was delayed 36 hours it proved to be totally inadequate. We had a limited choice of food with only half of the vendors accepting the boarding passes for compensatory meals. Queues built up to almost half an hour waiting for some people many of whom had children. Anyone has had the misfortune to visit Abu Dhabi international terminal 1 they would know that it is a small cramped dirty and very unorganised place. There are insufficient chairs and dozens of passengers were sitting around the floor in corridors and food spillage was evident everywhere even after I motioned to a cleaner. Toilets are unclean and insufficient for the number of passengers. Abu Dhabi airport does look very impressive from the outside the duty free/shopping area looks smart and there is a good deal of high tech equipment but that's where it ends: it is small and cramped the staff are either incompetent or more likely badly trained by Etihad Airways communication with passengers is abysmal - PA announcements are limited and the display boards are very inaccurate. The Abu Dhabi Airport website is inaccurate and not kept up to date. Catering facilities would make a small village shopping centre look impressive - and they do not cater for either the volume of passengers or offer them much by way of choices; the idea of queuing in order to get into a departure gate lounge is pathetic at the least and our case they made passengers queue for over an hour just to get to this point.

Abu Dhabi,Transited twice recently through this Airport and on the first occasion it was a nightmare. I had been through once before luckily because you land at the old Terminal 1 something nobody tells you and have to find the small signs directing you to Terminal 3. It's not easy to find through the various food outlets etc. You enter what seems like the entrance to a very large Tube Station and following the signs for about twenty minutes however we had to queue for about 90 minutes to get through security for entrance to the gates in T3. A complete nightmare with large groups of travellers milling around and making no progress whatsoever. The security gates in chaos with the personnel shouting pushing getting passengers to take off belts shoes etc. If your lucky enough to survive this you enter the shopping area. Small compared with Dubai. There are not enough seats and gates often have wrong information at the entrance plus be aware that the gates from 28/32 means that you will have a transit to your aircraft by bus. No enough seats toilets difficult to find and departure boards showing wrong gates.

Abu Dhabi,This is really 2 airports connected by a long walk. The new terminal (3) is fairly modern but very bad and the old terminal (1) is awful. In T1 you have to queue past individualized security checkpoints into overcrowded waiting area pods. Sometimes several planes are leaving from the same pod and it can be incredibly chaotic. There is nowhere near enough seating. The food and shopping are ok for a small domestic airport bu not for an international hub. Judging by its looks Terminal 3 should be very nice but it has a lot of problems. You have to walk through duty free to get to gates and it is a congested maze. It is a 10-15 minute walk from the security point to the gates where the Etihad planes depart and they announce boarding long before boarding actually starts. Because of extra security there is not enough seating in the gate area for all the passengers so if you answer the boarding call you can find yourself sitting for 30-40 minutes waiting in an outer lounge for the gate lounge to empty so that you can get through security and onto the plane. If you're flying business class forget getting on early unless you like to push people over. Etihad staff work extremely hard to make the situation tolerable and AUH staff are very considerate and helpful. It seems that the design and management of this place make this a most undesirable place to transfer. Etihad's lounges are fair at best but way undersized for the traffic.

Abu Dhabi,I transited through Abu Dhabi (onward and return) on the Chicago-Abu Dhabi-Mumbai route last month. The airport seemed to be too confusing and crowded with no proper signboards guiding you to the different terminals. All you see is gate numbers and you have to somehow know which terminal contains which gate numbers. Queues are pretty long and no airport official to guide/manage these queues. If you are travelling with infants remember that AUH doesn't have any sort of priority for such passengers. So you'll have to wait in the queues for hours. Airport staff especially at the ticket/transfer desks are unprofessional rude and have an indifferent attitude. I had booked a bassinet seat for my 10-month old baby but was told at Mumbai airport to try for the seat at AUH since most of the seats were taken. On checking at the transfer desk in Terminal 3 the guy at the counter lied and said that I already have bassinet seats only to realize otherwise when I boarded the Abu Dhabi-Chicago flight (15 hrs journey).

On our return journey the customs software went down (Aug 2013) which happens but the time to get the system back up and operating was extremely slow (2 hrs). With major events like the Grand Prix coming up I really hope they ramp things up to accommodate for the crowds expected. Just small things like customs staff wearing iPhone headsets under their head dress and they have absolutely no interest in being welcoming at all. Then the Taxi system waiting outside was totally out of control there were no lines or order to the process the waiting passengers it was every man for himself with Taxi's at one stage 3 deep across the road with people walking around moving cars.

Abu Dhabi,"Avoid this airport. Toilets are digesting not enough toilets rude immigration staff who are lazy and slow - would seem that they take delight in seeing how long they can take to process people. We waited for 3 hours at 2.00am to be processed while ""security"" were escorting others to the front of the huge lines - so lines were not moving at all!

We are regular travels into and out of Abu Dhabi and at least 90 percent of our flights leave at least an hour late.

Abu Dhabi,A transfer airport to avoid. I travelled from Turkey to Australia with a stop-over in Abu Dhabi and it was not a pleasant experience. Apparently 1.5 hrs hour is not enough to catch your flight - unless it's delayed which mine (luckily) were. It took about 25-30 minutes to get out of the plane onto a bus and drive to the airport. Then you had to walk to the transfer gates and stand in line for another 30-40 minutes for another security check meaning you are left running for your gate because boarding closes 20 minutes prior to take-off. You do not get to skip line because boarding for your flight had already started - quite frankly they make a huge deal out of stressing the difference between economy and first class passengers - only the latter are treated nicely. The information boards are not updated so only once I had arrived at the gate was I told that the plane would be delayed. At that point you're stuck in a gate with no access to any facilities. On the plus side there is free wifi but that's about it.

Abu Dhabi,The airport has come a long way but travel through AUH is still a rude awakening for many people. There needs to be better management and more thought put into the finer details. My biggest complaint is about the process (time delays) for eye scanning that passengers are put through. Management needs to realize that when there is a line with 100 arrival passengers but only one employee working this is extremely inefficient and irresponsible. There is no one monitoring this section of the airport so you'll have people who are impatient pushing and going through to the front of the line. In this section of the airport there is no seating for passengers after a long flight. People are left waiting for hours just waiting with no fans or air conditioning!

The airport is chaotic staff are fairly brusque and not helpful and there is nowhere to get a shower. In addition the Al Reem lounge was advertised as being accessible to certain MasterCard holders. The fine print as we were told at said lounge's check-in counter is that this is only for cards issued from Africa and the Middle East. Alternative option is the airport hotel which only rents rooms for the day. The place gives the impression of giving the ups to ordinary mortals like myself who travel economy.

Abu Dhabi,Through AUH to BAH. Arrived at a remote stand and bussed to Terminal. Clear signage made it easy to navigate along with plenty of Departure screens. As previously stated quite busy so seating can be a bit hit and miss but they can be found. However after 7 hours in the air a walk about was most welcome. Boarding through Gate 18 was bizarre a doorway that actually led to Gate 17 and 18. Even weirder was that two flights were through this door at the same time which led to confusion for passengers. Security was a drag with two flights passing through one metal detector and two x-ray machines. They got it sorted and we were bussed to another remote stand. Return was at night. Arrived at another remote stand and again a bus to the Terminal. I was travelling with an infant access to a stroller would have been advantageous at the gate. Upon arriving at Flight Transfer we found a fleet of strollers. Why position them here? A reasonably long walk down to Gate 34 (10 mins) with plenty of seating at the Gate in a clean and airy environment. Overall not a bad experience. Terminal 1 is rather dated but great for people watching and shopping. Terminal 3 is modern and bright but can involve a fair trek down to the Gates in the 30's. Be prepared is my advice.

Abu Dhabi,Transfer at AUH from LHR enroute to CMB and on return journey. Arrival at AUH Terminal 3 - this is the first time in many years I'd passed through Abu Dhabi and T3 was new to me. Fairly typical modern airport terminal - clean spacious lots of steel and glass. 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 for connecting flight - while still architecturally eye catching showing its age and feeling a bit sticky. 10 or so free internet terminals several of which weren't working. On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg). Once through security the route inevitably winds it's way through a huge shopping area before reaching the T3 departure gates. As is the case with T1 there were several free internet terminals.

Abu Dhabi,Hanging around in any airport is to be avoided and in Abu Dhabi all the more so. It is a deeply boring place to have to spend any time there being nothing much to do. The seating – what there is of it – is comfortable. The airport seems tiny. The mosaic dome makes a change but it allows voices to echo so is noisy. This is exacerbated by the continual – and I mean continual – announcements which are also impossible to understand. There is a Costa so you can get a good cup of coffee and pay in £ if you wish. I didn’t particularly notice the smoke that so many people have complained of. Crowd control is southern ie long queues and lengthy processes. The toilets are reasonably unpleasant. Shopping is very limited to the usual Duty Free fare of watches perfumes cigars and alcohol. There are no quiet places to sleep so if you have an 8 hour stop-over during the night as I did you are going to have little fun.

Abu Dhabi,I flew with Etihad from BRU to BKK with a 2 hours stopover in AUH. At first sight I found the terminal quite original and nice (the green mosaic); but tiny and really overcrowded. The terminal is non smoking but this is theory as it smells cigarette smoke everywhere. In fact there are smoking areas in bars but no smoke extractor so the whole terminal looks like a smoking room. Going from the 2nd floor to the 1st one using the stairs is hazardous as smoking is not prohibited in the piano bar between the 2 floors. Toilets are on the 1st floor. There look really old fashioned and are not so clean (lot of water on the ground). So what to do when you are in transit? There are 3 bars/snacks but it's almost impossible to find a seat. Prices for drinks are OK. Not so many duty free areas.

Bangkok,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport presents a tale of contrasts, with its impressive terminal for last-minute shopping standing in stark juxtaposition to the frustratingly slow immigration queues. Suvarnabhumi's shopping options are nothing short of spectacular. The airport offers a diverse range of stores, from high-end boutiques to local treasures. The expansive duty-free area is a shopper's paradise, with an extensive selection of products, making it an ideal place for last-minute souvenir hunting or indulging in luxury purchases. The terminal's architecture is both modern and aesthetically pleasing, creating a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere. The design incorporates cultural elements, adding a touch of Thai elegance to the overall ambiance. The plethora of dining options, lounges, and recreational areas contribute to a positive pre-flight experience. Unfortunately, the luster of Suvarnabhumi is dimmed by the consistently slow immigration processing times. Long queues, coupled with what appears to be an understaffed immigration system, can turn what should be a seamless process into a time-consuming and frustrating affair. This aspect significantly impacts the overall airport experience, particularly for travelers with tight connections. While the shopping experience is enhanced by friendly and helpful staff, the same cannot be said for the immigration counters. The personnel, though professional, often seem overwhelmed, contributing to a lack of efficiency in processing passengers promptly. In conclusion, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport provides a unique juxtaposition of outstanding shopping experiences against the backdrop of slow immigration queues. Travelers should be prepared for potentially lengthy waits at immigration but can take solace in the world-class shopping opportunities the airport offers. Suvarnabhumi remains a destination where, with the right expectations, one can navigate the contrasts and make the most of their time at this bustling international hub.

Bangkok,✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at BKK airport in early October and departed a week later. I have used BKK airport many times in the past 3 years. Overall it's a decent airport despite the large scale. Normally the biggest issue at BKK airport is the long queue in immigration. I was lucky this time as when I arrived there was almost no queue. The drama started after the great first impression. Due to bad weather the airport had to suspend all ground service. As a result we were waiting by the luggage reclaim belt for a long time until we saw a signed saying the ground service is suspended. Then we waited for longer and finally a ground staff came to inform us the luggage wouldn't be delivered any time soon. And when the ground service resumed we were shocked to see other flights that landed much later have their luggage delivered earlier than our flight which landed 2 hours ago. All in all a 2 hour wait by the luggage belt without much information isn't a pleasant experience and should have been dealt with better.,6.0,1,Solo Leisure,Arrival and Departure,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2019.0,trip verified arrived bkk airport early october departed week later used bkk airport many times past years overall decent airport despite large scale normally biggest issue bkk airport long queue immigration lucky time arrived almost queue drama started great first impression due bad weather airport suspend ground service result waiting luggage reclaim belt long time saw signed saying ground service suspended waited longer finally ground staff came inform us luggage wouldnt delivered time soon ground service resumed shocked see flights landed much later luggage delivered earlier flight landed hours ago hour wait luggage belt without much information isnt pleasant experience dealt better,-0.2964,Negative,Global Transit Hub

Bangkok,"✅ Trip Verified | I had a nine hour layover in this airport recently. I decided that on arrival I would transit (from international arrivals to international departures), buy a book to read and spend some time in a pay lounge. Arrival was at a gate (instead of standing remotely, as is often the case), about 400 metres walk to the transit area, and there were moving walkways most people used. When I arrived at transit security there was a line of about 50 people, staff looked to be under pressure and were grumpy, but I still was able to get through to the departure level in a reasonably short time. I then managed to buy a novel in an Asia Books outlet that kept me entertained, but it was from a relatively small and not very interesting selection. As other posters have mentioned, the air-conditioning in this building is not great, and the area I found myself in was warm and unpleasant. Instead of waiting in this area (my pay lounge booking still required a wait of several hours before I could enter), I went searching for a better place and found one in F area that at this time of day definitely was cooler and a seat became available not long after I arrived. I connected to the free airport wifi (I normally use AIS free airport wifi), but even though in my experience it's an OK service, it is limited to a couple of hours, so something to keep in mind. While I waited I avoided going near any food outlets as their pricing is probably three or four times what you’d pay elsewhere. It’s true that there’s a food court in the building, but that is landside, and not available in International Departures, where you can expect to pay four times the street price for a bottle of water, and four times the street price for a typical Thai treat, mango with sticky rice. Outlets are often crowded and the staff rude: I don't see the value. I used a pay lounge (I bought entry through a third party before I arrived in BKK) which offered free wifi for the time I was there, comfortable seating, a wide range of hot and cold foods from a buffet selection, drinks (water, fruit juices, beer and wine) — and importantly, shower facilities. it cost about B1,000 but compared to the cost of buying these products and services ‘unbundled’ elsewhere in Departures, it was good value. Closer to departure time, the walk from the lounge to my departure gate meant walking from one side of the terminal (F) to the other (A), taking more than 20 minutes. There’s very little in the way of moving walkways when you move across the terminal, so until you get to the departure area there’s little choice but to keep walking (much easier if you only have the lightest cabin baggage with you). Maybe the airport wants people to embark on a buying expedition through the shops on either side, but in my opinion there are better bargains to be had elsewhere. Flights to Australia have an additional security check before you are allowed in the departure lounge. The staff always check for liquids, so my advice is to drink any bottled water before you arrive and if you have bought liquor at duty free, ask the sales staff about picking it up after departure gate security. The departure lounge itself had adequate seating for a heavily booked A350, and there were toilets.

We tried to explain that this was our first visit to Bangkok and that addresses are written differently in the UK and she told us to just shutup and go away. After shouting at us to go away, she got up and physically moved us. We were scared and anxious - thousands of people around us in a city we have never been to before. She then threatened my little sister into keeping her passport when she had done absolutely nothing wrong, she tried to ask the woman what she needed to do to get through passport control.

Bangkok,"✅ Trip Verified | At Suvarnabhumi Airport the airline staff at check-in and security staff are good. The problem comes at the departure administration. On that day, only 1 departure admin hall was open. (Hall 3) I took the departure escalator at about 1.45pm and cleared passport control at 3.05pm (a total of 1 hour 20 mins !) There is a security clearance queue which took about 15 to 20 mins, in general, it is reasonable time as security is important. The passport control is however very disappointing, it was a 1 hour queue with the following observations while waiting in line. Elderly and groups with very young children/infants are in the queue. In all other airports I visited, the elderly and groups with young children will be helped and moved to a separate queue for their convenience. It is frustrating to see old people having to stand in line for over 1 hour and parents struggling to keep their children in line. This is extremely poor service, the passport check officer in front of the escalator should have advised these people to use the priority lane. Only 4 out of 8 counters are open on the section I am in. I would assume it is probably the same in other sections. There are a lot of extra processing (photo taking?) at the passport control. There is no staff managing the queuing, so it is really messy with people criss-crossing queues. Any staff that were there are not really interested in helping passengers, if any passenger approach them, they will be ""served"" rudely. Despite arriving at the airport almost 3 hours before my flight, I actually had hardly any time in the transit area. I can only grab a quick bite and go to the gate.

Bangkok,Not Verified | I've used Bangkok-Survanhabhumi airport a few times. This airport is huge and modern. It's easy accessible from downtown by train and a few places in Thailand by bus. The terminal is divided into 7 concourses (from A to G) and it can be long walking distances depending where your boarding or arrival gate is. Some airplanes are parked in remote stands which saves the walking distances as a bus brings passengers closer to the bagage claim on arrivals. I like the architecture of the terminal with Thai elements inside the terminal. However it can be hot inside the terminal at some places as the air conditioning is not strong enough. Also some places like the checking and immigration areas can be crowded. There is a food court with local food and reasonable prices below the arrivals floor. The lines at the passport control can be long but you can go to the opposide section for less waiting depending of time arrival.

Bangkok,"Not Verified | Bad decision to transit at BKK with kids, never again. We were coming from Narita, transiting in BKK, final destination is Singapore. We carried two water bottles for my kids, and bought two grape juices in 150ml bottles for my kids before boarding the plane at Narita. At the transit check, the officer was adamant that we throw away the unfinished grape juice, but said the water bottles were okay. So we poured away the water in the water bottles, and filled it up with half emptied bottles of grape juice. The officer said that is not allowed. We do not understand why, and she could not give us a good explanation and insisted that we have to pour away the grape juice before they will let us proceed.

Bangkok,"✅ Trip Verified | The 'Airport of Smiles' that is full of rude staff, unorganised queue and crowded elevators I travelled with my partner to Thailand for Songkran Festival. On our departure, we discovered the worst airport experience we have ever had. Although a big crowd was expected for the festival, the queue was terribly organised. There was no one helping to organise the queue. All the passengers were just confusedly flowing to random lanes at security check and immigration points. My partner and I went to the immigration counter together as we have normally done in other airports in many places. On our arrival, we had no problem doing so. For this time, the officer angrily asked me what I was doing. I did not expect what we thought to be normal to provoke his anger. I politely replied ""can I not wait here"". He rudely told me to step back. When I got to him, I told him I thought it would speed things up for him to have all the passports at hand. He was even angrier and found an excuse that he only has two hands and there is only one camera. He kept his angry face going and scolded me even harder about the 'queuing policy'. I gave up in believing in the 'airport of smiles'. I believe many places that I have visited prefer visitors who travel together to be at the counter together. Even if this is not the case for Suvarnabhumi Airport, there should be signs indicating so. Rude officers do not help to ease airport congestion, but worsen it. Given the long unorganised queue behind me, the officer already wasted almost a minute scolding me.

Bangkok,"✅ Trip Verified | I am forced to use BKK on many occasions throughout the year. At least I have the benefit of fast track immigration service, although I have yet to see any Immigration officer actually smile since this airport opened. The restaurants are expensive and of general poor quality. The wash basins in the toilets with their long U-shaped water dispensers are a disaster. They are permanently splashing water all over the floors. The duty free is considerably more expensive compared to other regional hubs. My main complaint, which I have made before, is not just the lack of A380 gates, however, but the complete absence of any obvious attempt over several years by the airport authority to upgrade more existing gates to make them accessible by more A380 aircraft. Last night I arrived from Hong Kong. The flight departure was delayed in part because BKK was not ready for another A380. Yet when we finally arrived almost 45 minutes late, the Emirates flight with about 600 on board arrived at a standard two airbridge gate. So upper deck passengers had to descend to the lower deck in order to exit along with hundreds of other economy passengers.

Also terrible customer service is a given 9/10 visits. The cost of food is around US$10-12 per person for Authentic styled food, including the lack of working air conditioning and a clean seating area. For that money 2 people could enjoy far better street food. The international chains they have such as Starbucks and Burger King go for around US$6/coffee, US$10 for a subway sandwich or $US10 for a burger. The authentic Thai handicrafts are ridiculously priced. I was looking at display pieces as a set and individual items cost upwards of $300/ per piece.

Bangkok,"✅ Verified Review | I often go to Thailand for holiday or for work. So, this is a reflection of my observations while waiting in line, since there's nothing else to do but people watch. We should not be surprised by all the news surrounding the long queues at Suvarnabhumi (and Don Muang) airport. I feel they have taken for granted the number of tourists that head to Thailand for holiday, conferences, etc. Regardless of a one hour wait or five hours wait, they believe the tourists will come. The attitude is clearly seen by the behaviour and work ethics by many of the immigration officers. Most don't smile in the Land of Smiles even when I say hello and smile. Often times you see a number of them chatting away with the immigration officer sitting next to them. When I look over at a different counter, I catch a diligent officer processing 3 people in the time it takes to process me, and I don't even need a visa to get in. This inconsistency certainly adds to the wait time, regardless of whether or not all the counters are open. Lastly, when they are done with your passport, often times they place it on the counter closest to them (not in the middle or closest to you) so you have no choice but to extend your hand in to take it back. What kind of service is this? All of them should go on a mandatory hospitality course to understand how to treat customers and improve their image. Suvarnabhumi Airport may be one of the best architecturally designed airports (on the outside), but once inside, it's quite dark and unwelcoming. The toilets are smelly and the floor is always wet.

Also more immigration officers are needed as this airport as the queues are often too long and many desks often remain unmanned in spite of this.

Upon arrival, there is a long walk from terminal to immigration (Emirates flights) where if you are lucky, can get through between 20 and 60 minutes.

Bangkok,"✅ Verified Review | Because of a technical problem on my incoming flight, the transit time had shrunk to 40 minutes before the next flight's take-off. I have to say, in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore or Hong Kong that sort of time window would be ""just nice"" to walk over to another gate. Not so at Suvarnabhumi: Right after disembarking we were stopped by ground staff who asked to see our (used) boarding passes and checked them off the passenger manifest one by one, which took quite some time. Another staff member did wait around with my next flight number in hand, adding to the sense of urgency - but that is where any assistance ended. On my way to my next gate, I was stopped and harassed multiple times, told to join long queues at some of these arbitrary 'pit stops', and shouted at by security staff who even X-rayed my shoes. Upon finally reaching the gate, the ground staff demanded I step aside and produce my ""bag number"" (?). To be fair, I did make it, and so did my luggage. But the experience was a nightmare straight out of a bad action movie. Couldn't the ground staff send a buggy and/or an assistant to whisk me between gates, if time was a real issue?

Bangkok,"I couldn't write a more mixed review of any other airport - they're usually generally good or bad, but BKK is absolutely the ends of both spectrum. Arriving in BKK at 1am was a breeze. Cleared through customs really quickly, had our suitcases arrive shortly after us, found the taxi system straightforward and got into the city within an hour of touchdown. Perfect. Leaving BKK at 8am was the worst experience I have ever had at an airport in my life. We left a lot of time, over 2 and a half hours, because I had a feeling one of our suitcases would incur oversize baggage fees and it might take a few minutes to sort out. The lady at the counter of China Southern was very blunt and rude to us (not BKK's fault, but I digress). In the end we were told it will cost 5,500 baht and we need to pay it before we can check our bags in. That's fine, except for the fact that the place you pay for the excess baggage is halfway down the building and at peak times incredibly difficult to navigate, then wait in another line, then come all the way back to check our bags in. What should have taken 10 minutes ended up taking over an hour. Immigration/passport check took over another hour. They had no way of fast tracking people who were leaving soon, and they were completely out of the forms you're meant to fill in while you're standing in line, which held things up tremendously because we had to do it at the counter as fast as possible. There were at least 4 empty cubicles that could have been staffed and there were hundreds and hundreds of people trying to get through. Once that mess was over we had to run as fast as we could to the very, very end gate just as they were doing the final boarding call for our flight. I'm not an emotional person but my 'no crying in public' rule was definitely broken that morning. By the time we got to the gate I was struggling to breathe and we just made it before they closed the walkway off.

Since my wife and I are both 1K with Star Alliance we sailed through the ticketing process and headed to passport control. Because of the infinite stupidity of whoever decides how to staff passport control it took us over an hour to get through. Why, because there were only 2 people assigned to passport control! There were enough planes taking off early that morning that it should have been staffed with at least half a dozen checkers. As it turned out we had about 5 minutes before boarding began for our flight. Just enough time to run to our gate. Other people in line were very concerned that they had missed their flight.

Bangkok,"Bangkok Suvarnabhumi taxi system has changed. It's no longer the counter that writes the name of the driver on a chit form and telling the driver where to go. Now, the system requires the passenger to press on an e-board to get a queue number. After that, the taxi will arrive to pick you up. Good? Well it does reduce manpower and perhaps technology is useful. But bad, because the drivers who drive in to the alloted queue number will not know where the passenger is going to. To be honest, my recent experience was a very negative one. 99% of passengers who arrive at Suvarnabhumi will be heading towards central metropolitan Bangkok or thereabouts in that direction. Instead the driver who was alloted to my number, he said that he was heading to Chonburi. If he was heading to Chonburi, then he should drive there direct and not pick up passengers. Trying your luck is a waste of my time. Anyway, his suggestion was to take me out to the main road so that I could transfer to another taxi outside.

Bangkok,✅ Verified Review | I've reviewed Bangkok Suvarnabhumi before and said I was pleased with how the queuing situation has improved. However the authorities seem to have gone backwards in this respect as the queues at immigration and security were too long both in arrival and departure. I appreciate that I was travelling during the busy festive period but then several immigration desks were closed and too many were for Thai passport holders only. By the time I arrived at the baggage reclaim almost all the baggage had come off and had I been a few minutes later I'd have likely had to go off and chase staff for suitcase. While catering facilities remain of a high standard the King Power duty free shops are overpriced especially for confectionery and three or four times the price of a normal retailer back in the UK and considerably more expensive than in Brunei airport. Furthermore the airport still lacks moving walkways in the departures area meaning it can take a long time to walk from security to the departure gate.

Bangkok,"✅ Verified Review | I have gone through this airport 8 tines in the past 3 months. It is a well organised and clean airport. The Airport Rail Link is a convenient option which lets travelers go between the city centre and Suvarnabhumi Airport. There are ample public taxis available for passengers wishing to get into the city. Just go to the taxi counter and get a queue number from a vending machine. With the number printed on the ticket, just find the matching berth number on the row of taxis waiting for passengers. Once you locate the berth whose number matches the ticket number you have been issued, just walk to the parked taxi and hand the ticket to the driver. It will be useful if you have printed the address of your destination (preferably in the Thai language). As there is only one terminal, there is almost always long queues first at the security check point for passengers leaving Bangkok, and again queues at the immigration check point. Once you have cleared the security and immigration check-points, you will then need to make your way to the gate which at times, may be a long walk away especially if your gate is far from the immigration area.

Bangkok,"Being from the US, I know many bad airports where security lines are ridiculously long and immigration, without Global Entry, can be a nightmare. Bangkok isn't anywhere near that bad, but compared to its neighbours at Changi, Incheon, Haneda and Narita, it's definitely second level. We have flown in and out of BKK numerous times, typically on the Tigerair hop from Singapore. This review covers our flight in November 2016. Arrival was fairly smooth. Immigration lines were long, but they moved pretty rapidly. I'd estimate about a 20 minute wait. By comparison, immigration time at Changi was about two minutes. Departure was where it got interesting. Check-in was smooth. However, when we got on the escalator to go up to security, there was one single person checking boarding passes to get into the security line. That line was backed up to the escalator and people literally had no room to queue and were falling over each other getting off. Very bad form. The security line was probably about 30 minutes. Tolerable, but still pretty long. Changi's security at the gate works a lot better. Immigration, for a change, was only about five minutes. We've been in hour long lines that crawl, so this was a pleasant surprise. We have the Priority Pass lounge card, so we went to the Oman Air lounge, as friends had warned us the Louis CK lounges were pretty gruesome. Oman Air was comfortable, but as with the Sakura Lounge we had made use of on another flight, food selection was, at best, limited.

Bangkok,"I've travelled through Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport many times a year since it opened a decade ago. The most improved part of the airport is the Security Screening, usually a 5 minute process, but rarely have I seen all the machines in operation. The worst part of the airport has to be Immigration both arriving and departing. It's been many years since Immigration was a 10 minute event... and I've waited nearly an hour on many occasions. If you're in the taxi rank within an hour of landing you've done pretty well. Never have I seen more than 50% of the Immigration booths manned, and often it's a lot less than that so clearly the authorities have no concern with passengers waiting an hour to get their passport stamped. The sooner they replace the surly immigration officers with robots the better. Check in areas are fine and mostly well organised. Baggage reclaim is good but I'm not sure what Customs do in BKK. The retail and food business in BKK are a rip off with the objective of squeezing the last of passengers money out of them before they depart. 300 THB for some noodles, 70THB for a bottle of water and 280THB for a beer is nonsense.

Bangkok,"✅ Verified Review | Crowded and poorly organised. Queues for passport checks are massive and nothing is done to prevent queue jumping by other travellers which is prevalent and very annoying. Getting through from check-in to airside takes far too long. Food options are limited and very expensive, bring some food with you. Immigration staff on arrivals and departures are miserable and officious, hardly a great welcome to the Land of Smiles, more akin, though not as bad as the open hostility often shown by US immigration staff to visitors. One very good thing though is that once you get through customs on arrival there are stalls for all 3 of Thailand's mobile phone service providers and the staff are fantastic and extremely helpful. Swapping your home country SIM for a Thai SIM for the duration of your stay is a breeze. In fact I'd kept my Thai DTAC SIM from my holiday 6 months previously and the DTAC people just topped it up for me and I kept the same number. I've used Swampy (as the airport's known to us farangs) several times and it's OK really but the queues for security and immigration are horrendous and the staff are less than friendly though scrupulously polite, it has to be said. Taxi's from the airport to downtown Bangkok are another bone of contention. Frequently over priced and scam-tastic. Trying to find cheaper alternatives like the train or bus, both of which are present at Swampy, is like a quest to find the Holy Grail. Well hidden and obscured. Not surprising as they are significantly cheaper (10% of the cost of a taxi). Sadly I think the staff at Swampy don't get to see the best of their visitors and like Thai's in other parts of Thailand who have to deal with stroppy, entitled, rude and even drunk foreign visitors, it's left many Thai staff rather jaded.

As an ex smoker I can say there are many more areas to smoke then in other western airports and all very well air conditioned. You do not come out smelling like an ashtray. The airport also has a buzz, a living soul and very friendly people. The problem with other new airports is that they are all tinsel and chrome and have no soul or passion.

Furthermore what is annoying is that the airport is very big in size with distances between piers large yet both in arrivals and departures there seems to be hardly any moving walkways and an airport this size could benefit from an automated people mover like at Hong Kong and Singapore Airport as it would make transit, arrivals and departures so much more comfortable and convenient for passengers, especially those arriving and departing from more remote gates.

Bangkok,"When this Bangkok Suvarnabhumi opened less than 10 years ago, it was touted as a challenger to Singapore Changi. Has this ambitious goal been realized? I started using this airport about 3 years ago for some long-haul flights. First impressions in 2012 were generally (but not overwhelmingly) positive. Since then however its been all downhill. My most recent arrival/departure experience in early February 2016 travelling to the Middle East and UK from Australia has only confirmed this opinion. Firstly, it has a vast layout which means long walks to and from immigration to your gate. Check-in and outbound immigration is simple enough, but the opposite is true for arrivals where long queues are common and even premium 'fast track' lanes are easy to miss and sometimes just as full. Secondly, airport management has decided to cut corners by not having full airconditioning in the departures area. In many areas its muggy and sweat-inducing. Combine that with a glass ceiling in a sunny, humid tropical environment and you can guess what the result is. My departure/arrival times are usually in the evening and even then it's quite uncomfortable. Just imagine what sauna-like conditions daytime brings. Your only relief is to escape to the airline lounges but not everyone has this option. The look and general aesthetic of this airport is terrible. You can see exposed utility lines and bare concrete. Charitable reviewers might call this 'industrial chic' but the fact is this airport was done on the cheap and it looks it. If this airport were a house, you would call it 'builders grade'. Food options are varied and generally well priced. Duty free is expensive and best avoided. Staff are usually pleasant enough although communication can be a little problematic. Transport links to the city centre is not as advanced as KLIA and SIN. Overall, this airport is not one that I recommend for ease of use and personal comfort.

Be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours plus at Immigration if you are unlucky to arrive at a time of heavy incoming traffic.

Bangkok,"Big airport, allow plenty of time when going international. I was flying Lao Airlines, and their flights aren't very full. I arrived into the airport via the Skytrain so went up 4 flights to level 4 which is the departure area. Signage was very good. I asked the information counter where Lao Airlines and I was directed to ""R"". All lanes are clearly marked. Check in was quick and smooth, Lao has plenty of staff and there was no one waiting. I then went over to the VAT Refund counter. I did not know you were supposed to have the items with you. Showed them photographs, and finally after some time my papers were stamped. I then proceeded upstairs to go through security. This was a little slower, but typical now at airports. I was told that a tube of sunscreen would not be allowed - it was a little larger than they allow, first time in 7 flights. Oh well, I went downstairs, back to check it it, was told I needed a box and was directed over to the post office in a corner where I could buy a box, back to check in. After that I had to go back through security, this time the line was longer. You then go Downstairs to go through immigration. It took 25 minutes to get through immigration and this was at 8.00 in the morning. All of the staff at the airport that I stopped to ask directions from, were kind and helpful and easy to find. After you go through immigration, you enter the terminal area through duty free shopping. I went straight to VAT Refund where again I had to show my passport (for the 5 time since I arrived at the airport) more scrutinizing, and finally got a refund in Thai Baht! VAT is a total waste of time, won't bother again. They make it difficult to receive. From VAT I went straight to the gate. All in all this took me 1 hour 45 minutes. Lots of walking and waiting!

Bangkok,For a time after some of the low cost carriers were moved to Don Mueang airport the queuing times at BKK's Immigration were reduced to reasonable levels.

Bangkok,As a regular user of BKK and other airports around the world BKK compares favourably to those airports. It may not be HKG or SIN but it certainly is better than most of the world's airports. Yes there are sometimes delays at immigration during peak arrival and departure times. Name an airport where that is not the case. I have always waited longer than at BKK when entering Canada the USA and many EU gateways. Security check lines move faster at BKK than those airports as well. When there are delays it is because of passengers who still try to bring forbidden items through or who are disorganized. Yes there can be long walks to and from gates but what do people expect at one of the world's largest airports? There are moving walkways escalators elevators wheelchair assistance and little carts to carry those who cannot walk The key advantage of the airport design is that one is not forced to change terminals. Transfers are a fraction of the time and without the hassles of the airports that have multiple terminals. It is easier to travel through BKK than comparably sized airports elsewhere. Airport restaurants are always expensive but BKK's costs are still far below those of airports in other countries. The lack of easy wifi access is a major deficiency but this is typical of most of SE Asia. There are multiple washrooms that are easily accessible and the washrooms are kept clean much cleaner than in the typical European or US airport. When there are problems with crowds it is usually caused by the tourist package flights which dump large amounts of passengers at one time and don't pay to staff up their baggage services. These package flights also fail to provide more than a few check-in counters causing the long lines for some at check-in. BKK gets the job done and the easy access to cheap high quality VIP bus services that can take a passenger to some of the resort destinations such as Hua Hin (-4 hours away) for 300 baht and elsewhere are a plus. The big problem at the airport has always been and continues to be the taxi /lLimousine service. The limos are over priced and the Taxis often refuse to use their meters. The need to fend off the transport mobsters who hang around the arrivals area continues to be annoying. This aspect of the airport does serious damage to Thailand's tourist sector and image.

Bangkok,"This is my sixth journey through Survarnabhumi this year and I have been through every corner of the airport. Like many other reviewers I find it a most annoying inconvenient and expensive experience. The ""Duty Free"" shops are very expensive and have obviously swallowed any duty with their greedy pricing: avoid them and buy elsewhere. The airport can be hot and stuffy in certain areas where aircon is inadequate. Airside food outlets are two to three times more expensive than the city e.g. 9baht soda water was 65baht. Better go to family mart outside immigration area where prices are normal. Also note that many flights require a bus ride across the tarmac because of inadequate terminal facilities. Immigration officers are expressionless. Forget taxis. Spend the extra money and book an airport limousine near the luggage carousel. You pay one fee - no rip offs extra cash for tolls and all that other nonsense you get with the (grossly underpaid) taxi drivers.

Bangkok,I've been a regular traveller (10-15 times/year) through Suvarnabhumi since it opened in 2006. It's a large airport and it's busy - always. Rule #1 - check in early. Rule #2 - if you have to wait for check-in baggage don't expect to be in a taxi less than 1.5 hours after landing. If you manage 45 mins you've done pretty well. Check-in can be slow but that's down to the airlines. (I always check-in online). Most of them seem to have enough counters available and international flights will typically be open 3 hours before Departure and occasionally 4 hours - so check in early. Upstairs Security Screening is usually only a few minutes wait I've never waited more than 10 minutes and I can think of many worse airports in this respect. Immigration both in Arrivals and Departures is poor and can be the longest wait of the trip through the airport but if you've allowed enough time it is what it is - chill and bring a book. The Baggage Hall is big enough belts are well sign posted and the longest I've ever waited on a bag was a Domestic Flight from Chiang Mai (about the same length of time as the flight). 20 mins in the baggage hall would be more typical. You very rarely get stopped in Customs and queuing times for taxi's is not bad. If you have to wait around there are plenty lounges Airside and seating in the lower levels both Landside and Airside. The Terminal Hotels are expensive and there are better options locally or in the city. Food is expensive and the choice isn't great but there is a food court Landside which is good value. (Burger King seems the busiest eating place). I rarely bother with Duty Free Shopping in BKK - I can shop better in the city. Distances to and from the gates are lengthy in some cases but they're pretty good at keeping the travelators working. Toilet cleanliness may not be at the standards of the best airports but they are cleaned regularly. Signs are OK and Flight Information Screens are very good. Touts still congregate in Arrivals and I still ignore them. The Airport Rail Link isn't the blast to and from the city which was envisioned but it works adequately. Unfortunately it's pretty overcrowded at peak times because of stops at intermediate stations. BKK is a better airport than it was 5 years ago but the Immigration 'experience' is poor and is a major bottleneck. Security is much better organised than before and the budget airlines moving to Don Mueang has taken some pressure off BKK. Given the space they have and passenger numbers they handle BKK should be a better airport than it is and as a passenger it's not a good airport to be in a hurry to get through.

Bangkok,I am creeping into my mid seventies now and I have found the business class flying in most airlines has improved over the past decade but the airports are becoming more and more of a nightmare every year. Taking the cake is this dreadful Suvarnabhumi Airport which stretches over a vast distance and has many areas without the walking machines. The distances are simply too long for many senior travellors and after more than a kilometre you arrive at the long queues at immigration and afterwards have to fight through crowds and up and down escalators to arrive at taxi lines. Hong Kong is only marginally better and in fact why do none of the airports give some attention to passengers who are getting on in years.

Bangkok,"Departure from and returning to Bangkok from Hong Kong. I did mention that the airport is finally listening as there are some minor changes however compared to other airports in the region it is not a comfortable event leaving or arriving at this airport. Passport control is much better than before however waiting times remain longer than optimal and the overall ""attitude"" of the border officers (male and female) can be described as miserable and lacking tact in many ways. Being 10 years here I never touched the glorified tax free shopping as items are pricier than in the city. It's just not worth it at all. Food venues are pricey however there is a food court with great food on the ground floor before you pass immigration to the restricted air side. Walking distances are very long and I cannot imagine older passengers going all that way to reach passport control. Wifi never really worked so I am wondering whether its just for show. The train to the airport from the city discontinued the red express line for some reason (it had terrible frequencies as well - every 45 minutes so it beats the overall idea of having an express train). The local blue line is alright but used by many locals on the way so gets very packed and full in just a couple of stops. My main anger with this airport is its inability to control taxi drivers. They are wilder every time. Once you are seated and left the cab booth many tourists are faced with immediate requests of a set fare that is double or triple the taxi-meter price. In several occasions people were ""offloaded"" close to the highway as a result. I discernibly see those cab drivers getting to be a problem.

Bangkok,I've been travelling through Bangkok maybe a dozen times a year since the airport opened and there's definitely improvements. There's not much seating in Departures so it's best to arrive around the time your check-in opens (typically 3 hours with International Flights). I always check-in online for shorter queuing times. The upstairs security screening is reasonably efficient as is Immigration with somebody usually managing the queue system. Check-in early and kill time airside rather than checking in late and having to rush. I don't bother with Duty Free in BKK - it's expensive as are all the airside restaurants. There's not much seating in the main concourse but there are quiet areas 1 level down and obviously out towards the gates. Arrivals usually commences with a log walk from a remote gate but plenty travellators to help you on your way and highly variable queuing times for Immigration 20 minutes would be typical most times of they day but an hour not unusual at busy times. The baggage is pretty efficient in BKK and it's unusual to have to wait more than a few minutes for luggage. Plenty of taxi touts in Arrivals but just follow the signs downstairs for Public Taxi or Airport Rail Link. Also the lower levels are quieter if you have to spend a few hours between flights. There's also a food court with better Thai food than the airport restaurants. Now they have Security Screening out of the way upstairs in Departures the whole flow of the airport has improved.

Singapore,"Not Verified | I want to express my disappointment regarding my recent experience with the early check-in process at Terminal 1 on December 7, 2024 at around 1.00-2.00 PM, for Thai Airways flight TG408. Upon arriving at the early check-in counter around 1:30 PM, I was met with an unexpectedly rude and unprofessional attitude from the staff member. After weighing my luggage and confirming that it was within the allowed limit, I was surprised when she immediately sent my luggage away without allowing me a chance to verify the weight or receive a luggage tag. When I attempted to ask questions, I was met with dismissive responses such as, ""It's already inside, you go inside yourself,"", ""It's your problem now; find your own solution."" ""You dont like, you can report to any department you like, I dont care"" This lack of communication and support was not only frustrating but also felt disrespectful. Given that there were only 2-3 passengers at the counter at that time, I found it particularly concerning that I was treated this way. Unfortunately, this incident did not end there. Upon arriving in Thailand, I discovered that my luggage had gone missing. I had to wait for the airline to search for it, which added significant stress to my travel experience.

Singapore,"Not Verified | Had an outbound flight on MH from Changi Terminal 1. Departure gate D38 is shared with D48 and D49 with common entrance and security screening. At the time i was to enter the gate, there were two flights - MH and FinnAir - open for boarding. Two queues were formed, with NO signage indicating whether there was any specific queue meant for FinnAir and the other for MH. The only sign was for FinnAir Priority pointing to the left queue. Both queues were long and slow (5 min to reach the gate check before entering). Passengers were mixed up. Since the Finnair Priority sign pointed to the left queue, i chose the right queue for my MH flight (not that there was any other sign saying where passengers should queue).

The airport staff were really helpful though. They explained that we have to wait in the line, because they can’t scan our boarding pass, because they don’t have this airline in their system, which in my opinion is nothing but pathetic.

Singapore,"Not Verified | I arrived into the airport and had a 24-hour layover until my next flight. I decided to leave the airport, explore the city, and then come back into the airport to relax before the flight. First off, the airport is massive!! There is so much to do and it's very entertaining, but it's so big that it's almost impossible to find your way around and everything is ridiculously expensive. I had to keep on asking staff where things were and when I checked the maps, it was hard to follow and it seemed like nothing matched the images. When I arrived back into the airport, I checked with my airline (Scoot) if my luggage will make it back to my flight, or if there is anything I need to do to make sure it will make it okay. They said there was nothing to worry about and it has already been transferred to my gate. I had time to kill, so I decided to take a shower. I found the little icon on the map and went to the respective areas to find the showers and they were not to be found. I asked the lounge staff where they are and they said I needed to pay $20 for a shower that is was inside the lounge. Not ideal. I wanted to see some of the attractions inside of the airport, but they were all way too expensive to enjoy. I went on the high bridge walk to watch the water and light so and it was $8 for about a 30 meter walk. This was the cheapest attraction, but by far the shortest. When it comes time to board, the carry-on checks is actually at the gates. The staff were very rushed and not making it a smooth process. They were very rude, no matter how prepared you were with your laptop out, jacket off, and all metal off. After the check-in point, we were held like cattle in a little room without many charging ports, so everyone was piling on top of each other for the littlest charge they could get. When I arrived at my destination, my checked luggage did not. I asked luggage services where it was at and they said my bag did not make the 24 hour connection. How could it not make it? If I knew I was not going get my checked bag, I would have done the transfer myself. I do not understand why the Scoot team told me it was transferred no problems, when it clearly was not. Long story short, the airport is confusing, glamorous, but not hassle free. I came into way more issues with this ""luxury"" airport than I did with other airports.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | All I have to say is, what an airport! Just Jewel in and of itself means Changi is a tourist destination, with a 130-some-odd foot-tall indoor waterfall consisting of recycled rainwater, surrounded by five stories of tropical plants that appeal to multiple senses and then seven stories of what's basically a big, opulent shopping mall. Said shopping area also contains a Yotel, supermarket, IMAX theatre (below ground!), and access to an upper-level plant walk, which includes a glass bridge overlooking the waterfall, and a huge massive net suspended in the air that you can jump on. I spent an entire day in Jewel just as a tourist. But exploring the terminals is also a treat. Terminal 3 itself would be one of the most beautifully-designed airports in the world, with the sound-breaking ceiling, incredible space for passengers to walk around in, and plenty of shops post-security. The staff working in shops and restaurants, whether pre-security, in Jewel, or post-security, are, for the most part, nice, helpful and respectful. Also, terminal 2 had a beautiful display to celebrate this Year of the Rat pre-security, and a beautiful, rooftop sunflower garden post-security. The flow between the terminals requires either a walk or a tram or bus ride, but the organization at this airport is very logical. Customs and immigration aren't the friendliest, but they are efficient, courteous, and don't have a determinable ounce of the hostility that I'd expect to encounter with American and Canadian agents. However, processing times coming into Singapore for C&I weren't very efficient, even though lines weren't long at all, so I have to take one point off the overall rating. Baggage pickup is very efficient. I was able to pre-check baggage in Jewel before flying to Hong Kong--very easily, all computer-based, and with more than four hours to spare before departure time. Departure security, interestingly, is done at the gate, which is unusual, but the security personnel were personable, friendly, efficient, and thorough, all simultaneously. Singapore Airlines staff at departure were also very helpful and professional. Any place I saw in the airport was meticulously clean; even the restrooms had large windows in front of the urinals, but bamboo plants to block any views either inside or outside. Wow, I mean, wow!

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | I suffered most of the Changi terminals in the last week and none were better than atrocious. I suspect this airport isn't about making travellers lives easier but rather providing an experience to infrequent travellers. Starting with the main terminal T3 arrived on an SQ overnight flight. The flight is delayed- so wander out to immigration. No sign of any staff- 13 desks, 2 with officials at which point one leaves. 10 minutes later they troop out - bearing in mind our flight was delayed so we can't have caught them by surprise. Luggage slow to appear and eventually get out and into taxi rank - few taxis, taxi marshall sent me to one, get in and halfway down the highway he says I have chosen a luxury vehicle at $60, normal taxi is $25. Next up - flight on Silkair to Surabaya. T2. Chaos at parking outside, no clear signage inside and eventually find a desk. Check-in and head off to immigration. Now in the queue from hell - we are all told to use e-gates, so in long queue although there are only two gates operational. Many people cannot use e-gates but they are made to try several times before they are allowed to give up. They new it wouldn't work but the immigration staff enjoyed watching them fail. Get to scan my prints - not working so I am sent to a new queue which is like Spanish Inquisition. Finally, get into terminal lots of shops but no useful facilities. Make way to the lounge and it is a shambles. Eventually, get on a flight having enjoyed the ""how many times do we x-ray you and you bag game"" Next up landing from Surabaya - obviously this is a destination (along with some Indian ones) where they treat you really badly. Off a late evening flight, x-rayed before I set foot outside arrival gate then it's off on a long and winding journey to get my bag. Finally departing T1 on EK. So chaotic arrival at the front door, with no clear signage of which zone to go to. Eventually, check-in. Lost the will to live with trolley. No staff available to help, but they do have lovely waterfalls to look at! Approached someone claiming to be customer service, abrupt and rude. Have usually delights of security with inefficiency guaranteed. Finally, get on the plane having been examined by security again. In summary, inefficient immigration, and obsession with security (but they don't actually pay attention to the screens they are too busy chatting), certainly dislike some destinations, surly staff and possibly ripped off in a taxi.

Singapore,"Not Verified | I'm entering a bit of serious criticism in this review. Let me first say that I think Changi Airport is amazing in almost every regard, but I'm having a major issue with the system in the past year or so flying in an out of Terminal 4. ISSUES: Arriving Terminal 4 and needing to transit to Terminal 3. It's confusing, difficult, and a long and exhausting process, especially in non-peak hours. I've arrived in Terminal 4 on a long international flight in the early morning hours, with a wait for my next flight on a regional flight on a different airline. There is no Transit hotel in Terminal 4, so if I want to get a good nights sleep, I needed to go to Terminal 3 at the only hotel at the airport, Crowne Plaza. It's expensive, and I've sometimes had to pay over $300/USD for a room (w/no b'fast), to sleep, shower and refresh. It's a great hotel, but overpriced. There are no other options at the airport. Getting from Terminal 4 to Terminal 3 is a burden. 1. Need to go through immigration and proceed to a shuttle bus waiting area. During the day the bus comes often, but at night, you have to wait quite a while. 2. Haul your luggage on to a bus. No assistance with this. (Sometimes travel is done with my wife and her bags are always heavy.) 3. Alight at Terminal 2. 4. Then walk above the Subway System from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. Ok. It can be done, but it isn't easy, especially after flying on long haul flights and arriving in the early morning hours. Singapore's Changi needs to get a better system for transiting from T4 to other terminals, and for $300/night, Crowne Plaza should provide a shuttle to pick up passengers. All said, I've lived and worked in Singapore and besides this big problem, I've always had a great airport experience, as I've traveled in and out of Singapore so many times. The Jewel terminal (mall) is stunning beyond belief. There is no place like it in the world.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | We arrived just past midnight of Sunday at Terminal One and was initially impressed with the renovation that has been done. However our experience at the taxi queue and whatever its intended design left us hot and flustered and we are embarrassed by its world class claim and visitors get to experience the same farce as us. Firstly it is already a terrible idea having visitors to pick which of the 4 queues they hope would be the fastest when all the other terminals have logical queue system in place. Then in order to counter this poor idea and design, you have to have so many staff trying hard (and very unsuccessfully at times) to direct users and explaining to them why (some lines are closing they say) and which queues to go to, adding confusion, irritation and frustration to people just coming down the escalators and those already waiting in line. Having this terrible system in place, where you have created very unequal number of people amongst the 4 queues, we imagine the other logical thing to do hire more staff just to direct taxis waiting outside which queue to approach first? And even that we can see that their decision making didn't reflect on the situation at hand. We were directed to the longest queue and yet the taxis coming our way were the least! After about 45 mins of waiting, my partner and I decided to split so that she could join another queue which seems shorter and before long she was already near the end of her line while I still had loads of people in front of me. Naturally I left my line and joined her and we finally got our cab. This was more than an hour of waiting for a taxi at Singapore Changi Airport! We are really baffled by your adopted queueing concept which is an old system that has been and still is a failure anywhere in the world and wondered whose bright idea it was to bring it to Terminal One when the queue system in all the other 3 terminals worked logical and efficiently.

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | Amazing airport with a few basic flaws. Walking through here is like walking through a nice shopping mall. Clean and plentiful bathrooms, play areas for kids. Plenty of help if you need. Efficient immigration staff. Not a fan of the carpet but not a big deal. The two main gripes I have about this lovely airport are: Lack of charging outlets. Not everyone wants to shop and eat and I would like to get some work done if I have an hour at the airport. No charging outlets in main areas, there are only a few at the gate where hundreds of people sit waiting to board, and then a few small isolated charging stations sprinkled in random areas throughout the airport. Really, Changi? After everything else they think of, they can do better than this and its practically a requirement now for airports to provide convenient charging access. Annoying Wifi hookup. Like I said, not everyone wants to shop and eat. They make you provide a phone number to text but my phone doesnt receive certain texts for some odd reason. So now I have to walk around the airport to find a kiosk and scan my passport to get a code that it only in use for a limited time. Hugely inefficient and annoying. What is the point of this? Most other airlines just let you log onto the wifi without requiring passwords to be sent individually to each person. Love the airport but I can't ignore these two basic things that ruin the experience for me.

For example, I'm flying to KUL from SIN with Silk Air, and the flight was code shared with other alliance airlines and too many flight numbers and airline logos are changing/moving.

Singapore,"Not Verified | There are several good things to say about Changi Airport. The place is clean, has a very warm and welcoming atmosphere and a direct metro connection to the city centre. There is very much attention to detail, but there was one big thing that spoiled my experience and might make me avoid this airport on future trips to Australia for example: There was no central security check in the terminal, but instead one at every gate. Firstly that means that you can't bring any liquids on the plane other than the free water you get at the gate and secondly - and that is even worse - it means that if you want to use a restroom shortly before your plane departs, you have to leave the gate and go through the security check again when re-entering the gate. Yes, there are no toilets at the gates which is very unusual. So this airport cares for many details, but left out the most essential thing of all. Security checks always are inconvenient and I usually arrive at airports very early to check in and when I complete the security checks, I know that there is no obstacle left between me and the plane.

I then roamed around while waiting for time to pass and when it was time to check in, it really made me fuming mad because the staffs at the bag checking section were really rude and harsh (the male staff rushed me and the female staff asked my sister to take off her cap with a demanding tone as if she were our mother).

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | First of all, the WIFI service is absolutely horrible, I cannot access the internet even after multiple attempts to reconnect. Secondly, the staff's mannerisms are getting worse from my last trip. I gave this airport 4 stars for the trip before this but when I returned in Feb 2018, the staff were not looking good. The staff in the food court in Terminal 3 were not friendly and they speak to you very loudly in a rude manner. The airport immigration officer in my opinion have mixed reviews. Some of them were polite and they will greet you with a smile. However, some of the staffs mannerisms seemed fake. It is much like they don't really care about customer service but they are forced to do so to show the travellers their manners. The airport staff should also try to stop using words like 'lah', 'nah' which some travellers like me might feel that they are quite rude as this is a customer service and not just chit-chatting.",7.0,1,Family Leisure,Transit,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2018.0,trip verified first wifi service absolutely horrible access internet even multiple attempts reconnect secondly staffs mannerisms getting worse last trip gave airport stars trip returned feb staff looking good staff food court terminal friendly speak loudly rude manner airport immigration officer opinion mixed reviews polite greet smile however staffs mannerisms seemed fake much like dont really care customer service forced show travellers manners airport staff also try stop using words like lah nah travellers like might feel quite rude customer service chitchatting,-0.809,Negative,Global Transit Hub

Singapore,"✅ Trip Verified | I usually travel through Changi every month or so and have done so for the last 7 years. Historically it’s been a pleasant experience with great Singaporean efficiency, but the terminal was a bit dated. I was therefore pleased when Cathay moved its services to the new Terminal 4 late last year. Sadly, although the airport is beautiful, the customer experience is far from being so, mostly marred by the immigration and security teams. I never needed to queue for long upon arriving at Terminal One, but on the last two occasions, the lines at Immigration have been at least 10 deep and the previously polite immigration officials are now sour faced. Despite being given a card to say that I am a registered traveller the first time I visited, the immigration officials now say that I cannot use the automated gates for registered travellers as I have a foreign passport. Upon departing, I can use the automated gates, but they are designed so an alarm goes off if you push your luggage in front rather than behind you, even though most modern cases are designed for you to be able to push it in front of you. The baggage screeners seem to be clueless about what they are doing and as a result, you are stuck at the counter for ages. There are no signs offering guidance on what needs to be removed from hand luggage. Sometimes they ask for liquids to be removed from bags (the only airport I travel to in Asia that requires this and it was never previously a requirement, despite all research now indicating this security measure is no longer required) and sometimes they don’t - in fact when passing through today, I was told to leave them in my bag and after I put my bags on the belt, the woman changed her mind! I also had a tiny cardigan on due to the fierce ac in the airport which I was made to take out and to retrieve my passport and boarding card from my hand luggage because they wanted to put them through security separately! Anyway, after a terrible experience, I asked the supervisor if there were any feedback forms I could complete and I was told no. I queried this and was told to speak to someone at information - but it was closed. Come on Changi Airport, this is not the way to be a world beating airport.

Never has long queues, either in security or immigration (and as a resident, you can use the biometric e-gates for immigration, making the process even faster). For departures, the security is done at the gate, so there are never long queues as you don't have to worry about how many flights are leaving at once. Combined with the immigration, it means you don't need to arrive hours before your flight - if you've checked in online and don't have checked bags, an hour is sufficient. For arrivals, I'm normally in a taxi leaving the airport within 20 minutes of landing (as I don't have bags to wait for). Even with the bags, it doesn't take that much longer. Things to note: as security is at the gates, any drinks purchased in the terminal have to be finished before you get to the gate but you can take empty bottles through security, there are water fountains at the gate, so you can refill before boarding.

Singapore,"✅ Verified Review | Prior to my arrival in Changi, the only thing I heard about this airport was my colleague telling me it was the best airport in the world! So, I didn't have high expectations, but, nevertheless, the first impression was good. This airport is neat, well organised and immigration was fast and efficient. To be honest, that's a real good introduction to Singapore. Of course, on arrival, we spent as little time as possible in the airport but I had way more time on the departure. On my departure day, I spent 7 hours in this airport (my flight was late in the evening and since I got kicked out from the Hotel beginning of the afternoon, I needed a nice place to work and this airport seemed to be perfect to do so). Check-in was super easy, border control was super fast. Without my luggage I was ready to have a look around. First good surprise, all 3 terminals are reachable once you're inside (there's an internal automatic train, but, if you feel like it, you can walk around as well). I found a very nice Cactus bar, outside, in the sun with view on the tarmac and, of course, with lot of cacti! That was the perfect place to work, very pleasant. Once done, I checked the swimming pool (!) that you can access for a little fee. It's a small one, but heck, it's not every day you can use a swimming pool in an airport! (only downside you get to leave with your wet trunk in your backpack....).

The only downside to me is the security control at the gate, once done, there's no turning back so, you can say hello to your bottle of water and buy a new tiny one in the only tiny shop available after the control.

Singapore,"✅ Verified Review | We had a horrible experience entering Singapore at Changi Airport. The people working there were rude, the air conditioner did not seem to be working, every passport line was back up to the far back wall. There are many airports in Europe than handle more people quicker than here. The passport room is poorly designed. There are two rows of counters. However, there is no way to access the second row. The second row counter is waving to you but the person in the front row completely blocks you from entering. So what happens is a security officer will randomly choose people on the outside lines to fill in the second row which is not fair. Of course there is no way of knowing this until you are up in the front row. There is nothing that makes waiting in a long line worse than knowing that others are arbitrarily allowed to cut far ahead in line. How is it fair that some wait 10 minutes while others wait 2 hours? Yes, there is a garden and decorations, and our Crowne Plaza experience was nice.

Singapore,"✅ Verified Review | I doubt that if Singapore Changi Airport deserves to be named as World's best airport after my recent experience at this airport. The extra security check near the gate after disembarkation was totally unnecessary, as all transit passengers will undergo another security check at the departure gate, so the whole process was just a waste of time. The fact that only my flight was being checked was surprising and I cannot understand the purpose of this excessive security check. Yet they put much less efforts on immigration clearance of passengers arriving at Changi. There were about 10 counters opened for that, and only about 7 or 8 people were in front of me when I started queuing to get through the immigration counters. However, it took me more than half an hour in the end because of the extremely low efficient passport checking process. However, what was more disappointing was that, after we have got through immigration clearance, we still had to wait for our last piece of the luggage to appear on the belt, despite the fact that by the time we got there, it was already 1 hour after we left the aircraft. Moreover, when I left Singapore via Changi Airport, the Wi-Fi didn't work at all. My phone could never reach the Internet to type in the password for free Wi-Fi for reasons that I didn't even know.

Singapore,❎ Unverified | There was a time when Changi used to boast that immigration can be cleared and baggage collected in 5 minutes. I have visited Singapore many times for business and leisure. Sometimes I spend just a few hours in Singapore on a connecting flight to another country on business or catching up with friends. That is no longer possible with long immigration delays. I arrived in Singapore on a SilkAir flight from Colombo. First time on SilkAir. Surprisingly a Singapore owned airline did not have Singapore landing cards. After filling the form at the airport I joined the queue. It was a long long wait. A passenger from the same flight who was in front waiting to visit the city gave up and left the queue. When I finally arrived at the baggage conveyor area they have changed the flight number to a new flight. I finally arrived at my hotel exhausted and wondering whatever happened to Lee's Singapore. You need more immigration counters for foreign visitors. For about 10 to 20 Singaporeans there are about 6 or 7 counters which appear to be a waste. Delay may be due to greater security concerns.

Singapore,"Singapore Changi has been one of the best airport in the world in recent years and there is no doubt about it. Design wise, Changi has some really cool architecture design.

After that you can chose to use the moving walkway or use a train (which is very useful for gates like A16-A21). After that, you will be greeted with a very big immigration hall and a very nice decor with plants and statues. For departure, is the same story. Very nice design. Once you step inside, there will be a lot of check-in counters and the main lobby has a very tall ceiling featuring a glass roof (sunlight comes in). Then going inside, there will be ground crew checking your boarding pass and you will be directed to the immigration in front of that. After immigration, there will be shops, seats, and lounges everywhere. For those who gets the further gates, you can take the moving walkway or train (same as arrival). Once you get to the get, there will be the last security check and then you can wait for the plane. Changi Airport is a very comfortable airport to be in.

This alone took more than 30 minutes. Obviously there was a subsequent queue at the toilets and it took quite long to get to the baggage claim. A queue at immigration (1h after arrival) led to another 10 minutes waiting time. I was texting my friend who was picking me up when I finally had network again and was told off for this by the immigration officer - there was a lack of information, instruction and organization from the side of the airport which led to quite a delay.",5.0,0,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2016.0,maybe arrived singapore changi bad day really shocked high expectations took hour get immigration point whole flight coming amsterdam including crew people squeezed doors checked upon arrival even crew complaining alone took minutes obviously subsequent queue toilets took quite long get baggage claim queue immigration h arrival led another minutes waiting time texting friend picking finally network told immigration officer lack information instruction organization side airport led quite delay,-0.862,Negative,Global Transit Hub
Singapore,"I arrived at Singapore Changi around 5.30 coming in from Amsterdam with SQ323. My transit time was at that moment around 5.5 hours. Enough time to experience the airport at which we were once before (back in 1981). The link between terminals 2 and 3 was good, within 10 minutes we were at terminal 3. Because I had not obtained a boarding pass for my next flight I was taken to a transfer-location, where at the desk a not so friendly young lady took my itinerary and printed out the new boarding pass without even looking at me. That was the only less pleasant moment at the airport. For the rest, friendly people at the shops, at the hotel where I took a shower, at the bars and restaurants and at the waiting areas before the connecting flight.

There were plenty of great shops, a quick scan of my passport gave me 3 hours of free WIFI and when I got tired of sitting, I was delighted to find a row of loungers for a lie down.

Free massage chairs everywhere.There are not many smoking areas but besides the indoor smelly ones, they also have outdoor smoking area. As long as you arrive at the correct terminal, walking time to gates is in most cases under 15 minutes. Train between terminals is quick. If bringing things in that may require paying tax, you'll find they have very easy to use ""tax paying terminals"" available where you can use credit cards. The whole process takes less then 3 minutes. I'm most amazed by their luggage handling. I often find my luggage is on the belt before I can even reach it. Lounges are good as well, with the exception of Sky view lounge. Food is good and service is great. One remarkable experience is that once I hurt my ankle at the airport. Within 2 minutes of limping towards my gate, a trolley stopped and a very nice elderly airport staff member offered to drive me to the gate. When I tried to tip him he refused to accept it. One of the few issues I have identified is that it is not easy to find a place to take your picture that you may require for Visa on arrival in other countries.

Singapore,"Flew out of Changi Airport on the 25th June for my flight to Hong Kong. The check in agent was friendly and the airport police stationed at the entrance of the departure hall was friendly too, it made me feel really welcomed. Being an aviation enthusiast, I decided to do some plane spotting airside. I headed down to Terminal 3, hoping to photograph a Qatar Airways A350. I set up my tripod, and start taking a few shots of it. A tourist was intrigued by my camera and tripod, hence we both started chatting. As the tourist left for his flight, a fellow police officer, I saw who was watching me the whole time, walked up to me and told me off that I could not spot there. He warned me rudely that my camera could be confiscated and I could be jailed. I asked him the reason why, and he told me he was not sure but still insisted I leave that place immediately. That ruined my mood in the departure hall. I headed back to Terminal 1 as there was not much at Terminal 3. Since Changi does not offer plane spotters like me to openly go into gates and spot planes, I decided to take photos of the screens at each gate. In the process, several gate officers rudely shouted at me not to take the contents inside the gate and I felt terrified each time they do. I gave up on plane spotting in the airside, sitting near my departure gate waiting for my gate to open.

Was told by security I needed to have printed boarding pass without any explanation as to why no such requirement was listed anywhere. The line for ""web check in"" seemed to simply be another check in line, which was moving slower than the normal check in line. When I asked for clarification from the manager the only explanations he could offer was 1? it was a budget airline so I was getting budget service and 2? they had over 200 flights to manage so I suppose I should just be patient.

Singapore,This airport is simply the best in the world. Terminal 3 is particularly nice as it is basically a mall with planes but even the older Terminals 1 and 2 are quite lovely. Perhaps the best aspect concerning Changi is that they always seem to be improving. Most Asian airports are a fair bit better than the average US airport but Singapore goes above and beyond. It is right up there with Seoul Bangkok and KL in terms of modernity and quality. I usually fly Delta which uses T1 but I always look forward to those opportunities to fly with Singapore Airlines which uses T3. The plethora of eating options and shops in all three terminals are impressive. While the aesthetic experience at SIN is top-notch the logistics are also good. The walk from the gate to Immigration is generally not too bad. The Immigration area itself is spacious and easy to use. The processing is very quick with the signature efficiency of the Singaporean system the key to the smooth functioning. I have never had to wait long to get through this process. The baggage area is just downstairs from Immigration and again I have never had to wait long for my bags to arrive. I have also had to get carnet documents stamped several times in the Customs area and found this to be efficient as well. When emerging from the secure zone there are ATMs that accept international cards though they are not particularly obvious at first. The taxi area can get rather bogged down at times. In T1 be aware that there are two taxi queues. On my most recent visit one taxi queue was quite busy while the other was wide open. If you find one line rather long try the other as it probably saved ten or fifteen minutes in my case. Taxi fees are very reasonable. I went to Boat Quay and the fare with tip was about $35 SGD or about $26 USD. I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza before and it is a very nice option connected to T3. Being able to walk to the terminal is a big plus. For those who are transiting through there is a rail system between terminals that functions well for those who are using this airport for connections. On departure the processing for both check-in and immigration is fast from my experience. The security areas are all individually situated at the gates. Be aware that there are no services inside many if not all of the gates so don't go through too early. The security is efficient so there is no need to rush through. The boarding process is generally easy and stress free. My major complaint about this airport might have more to do with Delta Airlines than the facility itself. On my recent flight there was no lounge available except for Business Class in spite of the fact that I am a Delta Sky Lounge member. Overall this is one of the best airports in the world. It is actually a pleasure to have a little time here as there are so many things to do making the wait as easy as it could possibly be. The logistics are some of the best in the world and Immigration and Customs are some of the few that function well.

Singapore,This airport was confusing as it displayed the best and worst of what an airport can be all in one! Arrived Terminal 2 toilets clean but mostly squat toilets! There was 1 western toilet in each block which was always full as no-one wanted to use the squat toilets I found this problem throughout the airport which was very surprising as I've traveled extensively in Asia and never seen this at an airport before. Passport control took over an hour by which time the baggage was left on carousel but no airline sign was on there so we had to ask. Airport looks great very impressive until we noticed the lack of basic seating. Most restaurants closed about 10pm so it was too late for us. They had 24 hour food courts which were great only problem is they didn't accept card. The cash machines nearby would only let us draw out 100SGD so didn't want to be left with all that money for a cheap meal. The airport lacked signposts and was hard to navigate we walked around to different terminals and others were having the same problem. They had wifi but it was different in each area so you had to request a code and find the information desk each time! Very inconvenient as sms codes didn't work. Had lots of problems speaking to staff in English which was surprising for a country where its the official language. I was very disappointed in this airport its like they are in a race to build more gimmicky things and are too concerned by the look of the airport to overlook basic things like restaurants accepting credit cards lack of seating and toilets fast passport control!

Baggage pickup is efficient, and baggage check-in wasn't too onerous for a budget airline upon departing. Customer service from airline personnel, to the ticket agent who directed me to the Airport Express train, to coffee shop baristas, was courteous and helpful. However, customs and immigration are the least friendly I've ever interacted with in Asia, though they are efficient, and they are not actively hostile like you might expect to find in North America. In all, there's definitely a feeling of taking a step down when flying into Hong Kong from the truly amazing Singapore Changi and even Seoul Incheon, but HK is still heaps above and beyond pretty much any major North American hub.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I was somewhat apprehensive transiting through Hong Kong given the news of civil unrest in that city. My fears were unfounded. On the contrary, I found the terminal to be much less crowded than in the past. I spent a little over three hours in the terminal and visited the Bridge lounge where I took a shower and shaved. Clean bathroom though the lighting is very dim. Given that the color palette of the bathroom was dark, it was a challenge to differentiate between the bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel! There are many food choices, both cooked and self service, in the lounge. The free wi-fi worked well. Helpful lounge staff. A silent airport with no announcements except for flight delays - need to keep an eye on the flight display monitors. Sometimes gates are not assigned until closer to departure times.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Being a clumsy traveller, I left my phone somewhere in the airport when I got off the plane. I initially thought I had left the phone in the plane.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong Airport is actually my favourite airport, although for others I know it's not the best. I like the large windows which are great for looking at planes, plenty of seats and dining options, and very cheap duty free/shopping in general, aided by the fact that the Hong Kong dollar has depreciated a lot! I would say that the location of the duty free shops could be improved, as there is only one electronics store which is not so convenient for transit passengers to see. Arrival into Hong Kong airport is quite a fast experience. After a lengthy walk from your gate, immigration is very speedy and our bags were already on the belt by the time we got out. On our way back, we took the ferry from Guangzhou to Hong Kong airport. This ferry is extremely convenient as you only have to clear Chinese customs and not Hong Kong customs as well. Saves a lot of hassle. Some gates are a bit badly signposted. We were at gate 36 which is at the very end of the long centre concourse, only a very short walk away from the other shuttle train stop. I had to walk very quickly to my gate as it was almost boarding time. There are a good choice of lounges from all alliances here, but the plaza premium (Priority pass) lounges have extremely long lines outside! In conclusion, Hong Kong airport has its faults, but I'm still overwhelmed by this airport.

Hong Kong,"✅ Trip Verified | I can honestly say Hong Kong airport is one of the nicest airports I've ever been through. To be fair, have I been in every major airport on earth? No, of course not, but I have traveled to many airports including LAX, ORD, EWR, LHR, CDG, HND, and so forth. For me HKG is easily one of the best in the world. The coolest thing in my view is the terminal is one huge open space. As in one huge roof that goes on, and not many different sections or terminals you commonly see at older airports. The engineering aspect alone is really fascinating. On top of that, the architecture and aesthetics are quite nice. It's mostly open, bright, and very pleasing to walk around. You very rarely felt claustrophobic in the airport, and the only crowded areas are check-in depending on time of day, and security. For example, the United check in counter wasn't crowded, but United only has 2-3 flights out a day compared to Cebu which is packed with several daily flights to Manila. Meanwhile security and immigration was smooth and quick overall, and it wasn't too crowded on my way in and out. The food and shopping options were quite nice. There were a lot of shops in the main mall before the gates, then another mini-mall with several shops around gate 60. You have many huge brands from Chanel to Calvin Klein if you fancy nice clothes, and the main duty free store was huge with very rare bottles of top notch whiskey and spirits. I bought some fresh tea and cookies on my way out. The only negative about shopping is I didn't find any cliche tourist store. I know it sounds cheesy, but I was hoping to find a mug or model Cathay Pacific plane. Meanwhile the food options are good with some notable fast food brands to local chains. The only negative is I didn't see many bars or food options in between gates, but they had the mini-mall and a food court halfway down the terminal. I can't complain too much, but it would be nice to have a couple options beyond a store when you're in the middle of the gates. Finally, the Wi-Fi was free, and worked well. The best part of the airport is the the train network to the airport is amazing. The high-speed rail is about $14 (USD) to Hong Kong station, and the train runs every 10 minutes. It was fast, and easy to get too when you pass through immigration. On top of that, there are plenty of ATMs to get cash, and they have counters and machines to get your local Octopus card. FYI, the Octopus card is their transport card which is a must-have in Hong Kong for the buses to subway. Finally, the signs are listed well, and it's easy to navigate around the airport. The only point it loses is it needs a bar or two in between gates.

Hong Kong,I have travelled through Hong Kong International Airport numerous times. Most of the experiences have been pleasant until recently. 1). Customs: As I was going through departure security check point I was asked to show my bag after the bag scan. The staff there dug through my toiletry bag with his dirty gloves without informing of what he's looking for. Firstly things in toiletry bags are generally more personal. It would be much more pleasant if he could ask before taking them out. Secondly those gloves he's wearing were protecting him but had touched luggage and many other things it would be much cleaner if they could have been more considerate and asked the passenger to show the items inside (at least I would have gladly done so) instead of running his gloves through the items inside and leaving prints on them. Thirdly that wasn't the bag that he was looking for. Eventually he told me what he was looking for and I took it out for him right away. Wish he could have communicated that at the very beginning. That way it would be more efficient and much more pleasant (and sanitary of course). 2). Immigration: I've noticed that recently immigration staff at HKG would throw a passenger's passport back at the end of immigration check. I had seen such behaviour at other airports before but never at HKG until recently. Hopefully that's just one singular rare event.

Hong Kong,Terminal 1 to and from DOH with CX. The usual long queues at immigration yet (as always) it never seems to take more than 10 minutes to clear immigration. Bags on the belt about 15 minutes after landing. The airport is still as clean and efficient as it has always been. In-town check-in still works incredibly well. Another positive is that some of the seating in the departure area immediately after immigration has returned - this is much-needed seating.

Hong Kong,Bangkok to Hong Kong return. This airport always amazes me of how quick and smooth everything works when you contemplate on the size and the volume of incoming and departing flights! Arrival a breeze. Hong Kong border officers do not stamp your passports any more. All is scanned in their systems and you get a small 4x4cm square paper with your passport info arrival and length of permitted stay. All takes a few moments. Many if not all airports in Asia and the west now seem so sluggish compared. Departures as well a breeze including security check. Train from and to the city is quick and clean.

Hong Kong,Arrived 9th November 2014 on KA692 departed 12th November 2014 on AK139. Plus points: 1) I stayed at the Regal Airport Hotel connected to landside of the arrivals section. Very good hotel with good service and facilities and reasonably priced. 2) Transport links are sound with bus and taxi options. 3) The terminal itself had all the essential facilities and conveniences. Minus points: 1) All passenger conveyors - escalators and travelators - have bollards that prevent passengers from bring baggage. From a safety perspective this is understandable with escalators - there are always lifts nearby too - but less so with travelators. 2) I did not find HKIA to be the easiest to navigate to my gate - wayfinding itself was fine but there were a lot of directional changes walking and the need to go from Terminal 1 to T2 by train in order to get my flight from T1. 3) The satellite building where my flight was leaving from was not well set-up for food and retail - the main building was but suffered from very heavy queuing which I could not afford to wait in. General thoughts: My experience of arriving at HKIA is generally positive across the board save for the initial feeling of confusion at the sight of high-rising escalators crossing each other in an imposing arrivals area. My experience from check-in to boarding the aircraft isn't one I look back on favourably - at the risk of sounding lazy I felt that a lot of time was wasted on the walking required and the queuing in the main retail and food complex added to my frustrations. However staff were friendly helpful and the security process was excellent.

Hong Kong,I find HKG's layout quite confusing and dizzying because of the Y shaped building configuration. About a decade back there was a common lounge area in the middle between the gates and the shops which is a good common meeting place for travel companions. It's gone now replaced by more shops. The only place you can actually sit down is in the gate area or (if you're lucky) in the food court upstairs. Food selection really not as extensive as Changi and not as much to do either. Immigration and check in was efficient and access to public transport is fantastic (which is good because it is quite a distance to city centre).,8.0,1,Unknown,Unknown,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Unknown,find hkgs layout quite confusing dizzying shaped building configuration decade back common lounge area middle gates shops good common meeting place travel companions gone replaced shops place actually sit gate area youre lucky food court upstairs food selection really extensive changi much either immigration check efficient access public transport fantastic good quite distance city centre,0.9154,Positive,Global Transit Hub
Hong Kong,Hong Kong airport is certainly very clean and has good facilities (water fountains etc) and plenty seating in the gate areas. Food-wise there are a couple of places (a Chinese place and a McDonalds) which while cheap for an airport are more than the same chains charge outside the airport in Hong Kong. The security queue's are almost always very fast (I have never queued for more than 5 mins even over CNY) but the immigration (arrival) queue can be a little frustrating and the bags don't always turn up very quickly (which I suppose is a comfort if you have to queue for immigration first it's not time wasted if your luggage still isn't ready). One tip travellers might be interested in knowing is that the shuttle train is not necessary - if you have time to kill and enjoy a stroll you can just walk past all the other gates to get to the other end of the train which travels underneath the main walkway. The main terminal is a 'Y' shape the train goes under the '|' part of the 'Y'. My gripes about this airport (my local airport) are that there aren't any relaxing places to have reasonably priced coffee it's a long way from Hong Kong proper and there is an annex which requires a bus to get to which is a frustration and not all that pleasant if you are unlucky enough to get relegated to one of those gates.,9.0,1,Unknown,Unknown,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,Unknown,hong kong airport certainly clean good facilities water fountains etc plenty seating gate areas foodwise couple places chinese place mcdonalds cheap airport chains charge outside airport hong kong security queues almost always fast never queued mins even cny immigration arrival queue little frustrating bags dont always turn quickly suppose comfort queue immigration first time wasted luggage still isnt ready one tip travellers might interested knowing shuttle train necessary time kill enjoy stroll walk past gates get end train travels underneath main walkway main terminal shape train goes part gripes airport local airport arent relaxing places reasonably priced coffee long way hong kong proper annex requires bus get frustration pleasant unlucky enough get relegated one gates,0.4127,Positive,Global Transit Hub

Hong Kong,Positive experiences all round. Arrived here twice left twice in the past month. It's fairly soulless is the only criticism I could possibly make about it. But for efficiency it is hard to beat. Immigration procedures were quick and easy luggage was fast to arrive and everything is so clearly posted. I loved too that those waiting for loved ones could actually see them on monitors before they emerged. It's a shame that Australia and USA have extra bag checks at boarding so you can't purchase water for the flight itself even after security. Guess those are the rules so be it.

Hong Kong,I always have the same bad feelings when I'm here. They have lousy food options since they have extremely limited choices of western food. The main focus of this airport is to please the Chinese clientele. Its hard to even find decent snacks and sandwiches to bring on the flight. The lines are also often long for the food places. The restaurants close at 10-11pm so if you have a very late (or early) flight don't count on getting any food.

Hong Kong,4 times through HKG in the last month including 3 transits and one trip into/out of Hong Kong itself. Transit: aside from having to clear security as a transit passenger this is one of the best transit airports in the world. All very efficient. Great options for shops and food though be prepared to walk long distances (when connecting between two 11 hour flights I'm happy to walk a lot). Great variety of duty-free shopping though some prices are much higher than regular retail (caveat emptor). The wifi is too stingy however: should be up to 3 hours even if add-supported for free.

Hong Kong,Had the honor of using HKIA last month when I flew on CX to TPE via HKG. Arrival time into HKG 1200.Though the terminal is quite crowded I managed to pass security rather fast and was at the gate of a flight about to open for boarding. Asked the staff if she could accept me on this flight instead of the one departing at 1555. In no time I was already seated comfortably inside the cabin of a B777 to Taipei. However if you land at HKIA during the peak going through security is a pain! So time yourself if you want to avoid the queue. The concourse is spacious not as crowded as Changi!

Hong Kong,Being one of only three 5 star Skytrax rated airports in the world it doesn't take long to see why. The airport is incredibly clean well sized and has plenty of on site amenities. On arrival I was through immigration in next to no time but the walk and then train ride from the gate was maddeningly long. The Airport Express train is one of the most expensive options to get to the city but by many standards is still an absolute bargain. My one big gripe with Hong Kong airport is actually about how functional it all is. Style makes way for function in everything. It is an incredibly boring affair with no flair or flourishes to make up for the monotony of it all. Personally I found the signage to be okay not brilliant and not nearly as good bright yellow signage commonly found in European airports. Some of the amenities are also really expensive ($200HKD for a shower seemed rather steep to me!) and the facilities for eating and drinking landside are a little lacking (Terminal 2 is better but most airlines use Terminal 1). One more moan - The time from gate to takeoff. The captain on my flight warned us that the taxi would take at least 20 minutes at minimum and that this is a regular affair at Hong Kong Airport. I have also learnt from several sources that Cathay Pacific leave transfer times between connecting flights that they have booked perilously short. Passengers have to be rushed through the airport by staff who meet them at the gate. They manage to get onto their connecting flights but sadly their luggage doesn't join them!

Facilities are great - toilets are clean. We were at Gate 60 but the staff at the gates weren't as nice as at check-in.

Hong Kong,I live in Hong Kong so pass through this airport a lot! It gets top scores but other than in comparison to other Asian airports I don't really understand why. It's not convenient to get to the Airport Express is only really suited for business men rather than locals and is also expensive (100$!). The busses are slow the airport is a long way from anywhere on an island. This is gripe number one because I often go to collect visitors so I make the trip far too often. My other gripes are that immigration is painful. I am resident but still need to queue up (albeit in the residents queue) which is better than most visitors - but still far too long especially on departure. The food/shop choices are poor. There is always an enormous queue for the food outlets none of which are any good (a basic sandwich shop would be nice) maybe McDonald's is the most popular (and cheapest). There is no cheap coffee either (except at McDonald's) and the shops are almost without exception fashion clothes watches etc. (all super expensive) which are useless for most people. Security is on the whole (surprisingly) sensible (that is not too strict on the >100ml liquids) and fast. It's clean and has a viewing deck (which costs money another sad point). Overall it's a shame this is my local airport given how far away it is from anyone and how pricey all the shops are.

Hong Kong,HKIA immigration seems to be getting worse each and every time I come to Hong Kong. Staff don't have the slightest understanding of service at all - no proper communication and if there was any it was certainly as cold as the Siberian winter. At least bags were delivered promptly so no complaints there. Everything was properly sign- posted - it was easy to get out of the airport and into the city with the bus park right at the doorstep of the arrivals area. Departing HK I used the check-in facilities at Hong Kong Station so not able to elaborate on check-in at the airport. Immigration was a bit slow few counters open and took about 15 minutes to clear a huge number of passengers rushing to catch their flight. Thankfully I got to my gate on time with minutes to spare thanks to the automated train (as Cathay had not even issued a boarding call despite flight being scheduled for take-off in under 30 minutes) and managed to do a bit of shopping.

Hong Kong,Landed at 4.30pm and immigration was fast and efficient as there were staff to guide us to the proper lanes. There were long queues but it was fast and not really a long wait. The customer service was horrible and some were downright rude when we asked for directions or buying staff at the airport. However the redeeming factor was the city check in which could let us walk around Hong Kong without dragging luggage and finding places to store them. Airport express was clean and fast. Group tickets for 3 are at HKD210 which are cheaper than the ticket machines.

Hong Kong International Airport is famous for its convenience and efficiency and of course it is very efficient taking less than ten minutes to pass security check and emigration. Airport is generally clean although some glass windows are sometimes dirty. Facilities are sufficient but the observation deck is not an impressive spot to visit. However ground staff lack service enthusiasm. Check-in staff were generally efficient but they don't try their best to help the customers such as not notifying the passengers that the aircraft and the seat are changed which I experienced when Cathay Pacific changed the B777-300 to B747-400.

Hong Kong,Recently travelled through Hong Kong and my main issue was baggage handling. The time it took from disembarking my CX flight to reaching the main concourse was over one hour due to being held up by baggage not coming out. I was particularly frustrated and anxious as I only had a 2 hour connection for a QF flight. As more people gathered around the belt by the time the luggage eventually came out it was chaotic and a matter of push and shove to collect bags. Problem was compounded with long immigration and security lines and 2 of the end counters for immigration were not in use which was very poor supervision by staff considering the situation. Once on the main concourse after 1.5 hrs whilst I couldn't get a thorough look around there weren't many Western food outlets and just lines of shops it really didn't offer much. Departures was just as bad and customs and immigration once again inefficient.

The upper level airside used to have lots of comfy seats but these have now been removed to make way for even more ""shopping opportunities” and restaurants – yet there is still plenty of unused space which could be used for seats! It seems that the only way to get a seat without buying something is to head straight for the gates where there is lots of seating (and better views of the runways). My other complaint is that there is still hardly anywhere to buy bottled drinks etc. airside – there are several branches of Relay towards the gates but they have a poor range of products compared to their European stores.

Hong Kong,Hong Kong airport is like a second home for me considering that it is a mandatory stop for all my flights out of Taipei to Europe and the middle East. I very much enjoy the layovers in this airport as it is very spacious great facilities food shops relaxation and entertainment areas. However I have to agree with the last few reviews regarding the very long queues in security queues are getting worse and are becoming a real annoyance especially when you have a short transfer time. Immigration which I pass through only 20% of my stops in Hong Kong airport is by far the worse I seen in Asian airports.

Hong Kong,"Hong Kong International Airport is supposed to be one of the region's leading airports - and indeed it was and had been for a number of years after its opening. However I traveled through the airport twice in the last month and found it to be becoming crowded and on the second visit found the security screening slow inefficient and rude. So much so that the passenger behind me called it ""out of touch"". I agree. My flight arrived at around 6.30am from a long overnight run from Vancouver. Apparently security screening services are drawn down in lean hours - and this was surely the case. Tired from our trip we had to walk a long way to go through security screening as transit passengers (why such screening is necessary is never made clear and the rude security people don't answer questions). There was a line of well over 100 passengers some visibly annoyed that certain other passengers appeared to be jumping the line. When I finally reached the point of being ""screened"" I placed my things on the conveyor and walked towards the metal detector. I was told to stop for some unknown reason. When I asked why the security ""person"" rudely told me: ""don't ask"". It's time that Hong Kong authorities recognize that security is a two-way street. Passengers will co-operate if screening is professional and courteous.

Hong Kong,I am getting very disappointed by the service provided by Hong Kong Airport in the past several months. First of all it is getting longer to clear the immigration and customs at both arrival and departure. The average waiting time is approaching 30 minutes. This is not acceptable compare to airports in Singapore or even Thailand. Second the wireless Internet and Power Outlet service is just not sufficient. I am currently sitting at Gate 18 and there is not a single open power outlet (only 4 of them are available and all are in use). Also the speed of Wireless Internet is very slow.

Hong Kong,SHA to SYD via Hong Kong with Dragonair and Cathay Pacific. This was my third time to this world-class aviation hub and I would say it's worthwhile to spend some time here just to enjoy during the transit though I could have chosen direct flight from Shanghai to Sydney. The transit was quick and efficient. After having passed the security check quickly I just entered one lounge. I took a shower and had some tasty food inside the lounge and of course got myself revitalized and was ready for my connecting flight.

Hong Kong,Used to be a fan of this giant airport but the quality of the airport is declining over past few visits. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon flight with a transit to another Asian city. When I booked my ticket on Cathay Pacific they offer a connecting flight with 50 minute lay over. Normally this should be sufficient for an efficient airport but to be on the safe side I opted for another flight that gave me 2 hour lay over in Hong Kong. Once I left the airplane I went to the transit area immediately and was surprised to find a long queue. The security area was not under staffed but they just didn't work effectively. Despite the long queue there was only one line opened (with 8 members of the staff). It took me at least 40-50 minutes just to go through security and had to run all the way to the other end of the airport to catch another flight. This is very similar to the arrival experience where there is always a long queue. On my return journey I travelled from Kowloon to the airport. The Airport Express was still a very smooth journey and the departure experience was so much better than transit. However the airport is starting to show its age and has become less exciting.

Hong Kong,I have flown in and out of Hong Kong on numerous occasions having lived there for a few years. No complaints about anything. Immigration is usually fast and easy especially if you carry a Hong Kong ID card. Connections to the city are frequent albeit slightly expensive via the AirTrain. If time is not an issue take the bus - it is 15-20 mins longer and costs less than half the price of the Air Train. Baggage is efficient and staff are quite helpful.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | We travelled through Delhi Airport to go from Amsterdam to Chennai. For this, we needed to pick up our checked in bags from the security belt and go to a check-in counter again. Picking up the bags went smoothly, everything after that was everything except that. We were initially supposed to have an 8 hour stopover in Delhi, of which we managed to spend approximately half an hour not standing in queues. By the time we reached Delhi Airport, there was a long queue at the check in counters for domestic transfers. This queue started in a straight line, but this quickly turned into chaos with everyone trying to push each other all over to get in front of the others. The staff in this time was doing nothing but shouting at people, giving them wrong directions to get rid of people, rather than help them out. After standing in the queue for about 1.5 hours, we finally reached the counter, just to be told that the belt does not work, which was weird considering bags were still moving on it. We knew there was nothing wrong with the belt but they basically forced us to go to a different floor for check-in, promising us there would be no queue. Surprise surprise, what do you think we encountered there? Just when we thought we survived the drama, we ended up in the line for security. Once again, people pushing to cut the line, but alright, this is nothing the staff can do anything about. What they can improve on is not shouting at the people travelling; some people might consider this human decency but maybe there is a different definition of this in supposedly ""the best airport of India"".

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | Arrived and spent far too much time in the 'Business Class' line for entry / transit - should have gone all the way to the end where they had 10 times as many people dealing with e-vias. Technology for fingerprint scanning rarely works, taking multiple tries to just scan one finger / thumb. My partner is Chinese and it took him much longer to pass through than me. Exited and had luggage to check in for our next flight. Was sent all the way to the end of the arrivals area to follow the sign for departures and lined up. Spent time waiting in the line with a luggage filled trolley each only to get to the front of the queue to be told to ‘go that way’. Nothing more. Rude and unacceptable behaviour of the staff. Was approached by another member of staff while wandering ‘that way’ to be told that we needed to go to transit. We explained what happened and asked why. Finally told that it was because there were no lifts at that end of the airport. Lined up at the midpoint area of arrivals to wait for one member of staff to stop looking at his phone and finally look at our passports. He said nothing, just handed them back. No directions, no instruction, just waved us through. Signs on the lift state 'no trolleys beyond this point'. So, we lifted all our luggage off our trolleys and then were told that it was OK to take a trolley into the lift. So, loaded up a trolleys again. Checked in, went to the ‘business class’ entry point for passport control which took forever. Went to the business class luggage scan – which took forever and then was stopped and searched because I had a fridge magnet in my hand luggage. A fridge magnet? Really? Technology needs to be updated. Passed my luggage through the machine again and just left it there on the rollers, waiting for all of the other passengers to pass through and be searched before I had to abruptly ask for my luggage to be returned to me. Staff are rude and ignore you, if even speak with you at all. Time wasted. Thank goodness our flight was much later in the evening. There were at least half a dozen people who clearly had similar delays and were late for their flight. At least they were polite and explained as they requested to pass that they were late for their flight and needed to jump the queue – no problem with that at all. Arrived at the lounge almost 2 hours after landing from our previous flight and the technology to scan your passport to get a coupon for wifi was slow and lethargic – rather like the staff.

Delhi,"Not Verified | Delhi Airport (IGI, Terminal 3) adds so much chaos to the travel. Starts with a entry gate where there is a separate que to register the boarding pass after which passengers have to walk back and go through a different gate for entry. This is something which could happen in sequence and there was no need for additional checkpoint and confusion. The new self checkin baggage drop counters needed to have some back up plans before full time launch. Most counters have glitches and some suddenly become dysfunctional. And when there is a such a glitch, the que is shifted to next counter without any system. This adds significant inconvenience, delay and frustration! Some layouts such as having domestic check-in counters opposite International Security check counters and vice versa is adding so much to the inconvenience. The system of smart tray systems at security check could be so much better. The purpose is so that people can easily offload the bags for security check and push it in easily. But the purpose itself is defeated. People are made to carry the smart trays, load their bags and stay back in ques as it used to happen with usual trays adding to unwarranted chaos and a mess at the security check counters.",6.0,1,Solo Leisure,Departure Only,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2024.0,verified delhi airport igi terminal adds much chaos travel starts entry gate separate que register boarding pass passengers walk back go different gate entry something could happen sequence need additional checkpoint confusion new self checkin baggage drop counters needed back plans full time launch counters glitches suddenly become dysfunctional glitch que shifted next counter without system adds significant inconvenience delay frustration layouts domestic checkin counters opposite international security check counters vice versa adding much inconvenience system smart tray systems security check could much better purpose people easily offload bags security check push easily purpose defeated people made carry smart trays load bags stay back ques used happen usual trays adding unwarranted chaos mess security check counters,-0.7644,Negative,Indian
Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I were travelling with our 6 month old baby. It really was one of the worst airport experiences we have ever had. When leaving, we arrived to terminal 3 over 3h before. There are no signs at all for which door to use for international departures so you have no choice but to ask people for help, who will only help you if you pay them. We eventually got into a queue and the security guard was demanding to see airline tickets. We had everything on our phones - but no access to WiFi to be able to display the tickets. We could not download the boarding passes as BA advised they needed to be collected from the desk. This resulted in an unnecessary stand off with my husband desperately trying to explain. If passengers are required to have e tickets then airlines should be advising passengers to have this printed or risk not being allowed into the airport. This would be less of an issue if we could access WiFi, but we could not get a code without physically being in the airport to visit a kiosk. We thrn entered the security queue. As I mentioned we were travelling with a 6 month old baby and we therefore carried a bag filled with baby items including milk, baby food, nappies, wipes etc. your staff stopped the bag - stating we had batteries in it. My husband emptied the bag and showed there were no batteries or anything illegal for that matter. The staff still refused to allow the bag through even though they could see it contained essential items for our baby. They then very vigorously searched my husband. My husband then became quite upset and anxious given how vital it was we had this whilst travelling. My husband repeatedly asked what was the reason for withholding the bag, not once did they give an answer that made any sense, they just seemed to be exercising their authority. Eventually again after a long stand off we got the bag. It was completely unnecessary, upsetting and stressful. It is shameful that they treat people in this way.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | I was flying to London, Gatwick and I had a transit in Delhi Airport. As soon as I was taken through security check there were two guards sitting at the entrance to check boarding pass, As I was escorted by one of the Airport staff he told me to show my boarding pass to them instead they told me to go through and started laughing as if they were making fun of me, I ignored it and moved on to where they would check my hand luggage. As my bag went through scanner, One of the guard told me to open my bag he told me to take out everything so I took everything out as instructed which point he happened to see my cigarette and e-liquid, He told me that is not allowed and I asked why, Another guard approaches he says the same thing, I asked him the reason why is it not allowed, I asked them if e-cigarettes and e-liquids are classed as illegal drugs. Instead of answering my question they start talking amongst themselves in their language, I felt like they were talking about me which made me feel really uneasy. Also to check one person they use two to three person, I felt like I was in a police station and not in International transit, I felt very intimidated. It looked they have done this to other international passengers as well. If that is how their security staff works then they might as well hire a thug. They didn't made me feel secure at all.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | Delhi Airport is run by incompetence and is a complete shambles. On a positive side - the airport is very clean, including the toilets. On our arrival into the airport, it was very early in the morning and there were very few people around, but it took us nearly 40 minutes to get through passport control as the people were finger print scanning everyone and insisting on all paperwork being filled out the way they wanted. Once they had this paperwork, they were very slow at processing it. The whole arrivals area looks pretty grim, particularly past customs. After you collect your bags, you have to walk through a long shopping mall before you finally get to customs and out to the door. We were expecting people and touts everywhere, but surprisingly this wasn't the case and it was a calm and peaceful entry into India. Our departure was the opposite.... as I said before - complete shambles. Delhi Airport's International terminal had been completely upgraded / rebuilt and looks very nice and clean - unfortunately the government must have run out of money after paying for the President's new jet and could not afford to put in a decent security screening system - I'll get back to this later. Before getting into the airport, you must have a boarding pass, which we didn't have so we had to argue with the soldier on duty and he finally let us in after we showed him our passports and a flight ticket. There are several of these check points and it is not clear which check point you have to go to unless you are in an Indian Airline. Inside the terminal looks nice, fresh and clean and I guess they want to keep the touts, pickpockets etc out of the airport. After check in was passport control - the guy on the desk did his job, but was surly and he stamped our passport and boarding pass - at this stage I thought things were going too smoothly until security. Security at Delhi Airport requires you to wait in line while removing all electronics and plugs out of your bag and holding on to them. When you get to the front of the queue you have to get your boarding pass out again and passport and show it to a security staff member, you have to find several small trays to put all of your things in so nothing is on top of each other, then wait in another line (we had to hold 6 of these trays). When we got to the front of this queue, we had to get our boarding passes and passports out again and show them to another security staff member. Next, males and females are separated, walk through the metal detector to another staff member and show your boarding passes and passports again. Eventually our bags and belongings turned up from the scanner about 5 minutes later, but there was no table or space we could comfortably put our things back into our bags. As I mentioned before the Indian Government has made a nice looking modern airport (departures side) with clean facilities, plenty of space and adequate eating places, but it has not invested in a decent and efficient Security screening system, which is why it is complete shambles. My only other complaint is why all the areas where you can sit and watch the planes coming and going are all locked off as departure gates and people like me can't find somewhere to sit and watch the aircraft coming and going. Overall, I would have a good impression of Delhi Airport if they fixed the security screening, but we won't be flying into Delhi again.",3.0,0,Family Leisure,Arrival and Departure,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2024.0,trip verified delhi airport run incompetence complete shambles positive side airport clean including toilets arrival airport early morning people around took us nearly minutes get passport control people finger print scanning everyone insisting paperwork filled way wanted paperwork slow processing whole arrivals area looks pretty grim particularly past customs collect bags walk long shopping mall finally get customs door expecting people touts everywhere surprisingly wasnt case calm peaceful entry india departure opposite said complete shambles delhi airports international terminal completely upgraded rebuilt looks nice clean unfortunately government must run money paying presidents new jet could afford put decent security screening system ill get back later getting airport must boarding pass didnt argue soldier duty finally let us showed passports flight ticket several check points clear check point go unless indian airline inside terminal looks nice fresh clean guess want keep touts pickpockets etc airport check passport control guy desk job surly stamped passport boarding pass stage thought things going smoothly security security delhi airport requires wait line removing electronics plugs bag holding get front queue get boarding pass passport show security staff member find several small trays put things nothing top wait another line hold trays got front queue get boarding passes passports show another security staff member next males females separated walk metal detector another staff member show boarding passes passports eventually bags belongings turned scanner minutes later table space could comfortably put things back bags mentioned indian government made nice looking modern airport departures side clean facilities plenty space adequate eating places invested decent efficient security screening system complete shambles complaint areas sit watch planes coming going locked departure gates people like cant find somewhere sit watch aircraft coming going overall would good impression delhi airport fixed security screening wont flying delhi,0.9907,Positive,Indian

There is a great range of food and drink outlets at reasonable prices, including pay for lounges, which again are competitively priced compared to many European countries. Some really nice shops also for all budgets, unlike the overpriced designer outlets which dominate many other countries. They really need to do something about the queuing times, which are some of the worst I have experienced anywhere. Arrivals can be hit or miss, but this time on departure, I arrived a full 3 hours before the flight, but had to queue first 10 mins to enter terminal (normal in South Asia) then appalling 1 hour to check-in for Air India. There were no bag drops for people who had checked in online. After that there was 30 mins for immigration, then security another 30 mins. There were not a substantial amount of people, it was just the process was so slow, and many counters were unattended.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | Had a domestic to international transfer. Followed the signs to an area that looked like customs. They seemed to be turning non Indians away and told us essentially to go out through arrivals. Asked for help a few times as the signs were very unclear. Finally ended up walking what must have been a kilometer to very poorly signed location where a guard directed us up to the main departures area. Went to go through customs and redo security but customs wouldn't let me through as I had a long transfer (8 hours). At any regular airport this would not be an issue but of course here they make life difficult. I tried to get help but everywhere I went I was told there was nothing that can be done and all told me different times I could pass into the international terminal. I paid for a business class ticket so I could stay in the lounge during the layover but instead I was in the departure hall with hundreds of people with many sitting on the ground due to lack of seats. No restaurants or anything in the departure hall so just stuck there. I had to go to the washroom but couldn't stomach it. I tried to return to arrivals as I had seen a lounge there but I wasn't allowed. I tried to leave the airport and even that was not permitted they told me I'd have to walk to the other side of the airport to exit. I tried getting help from the airline and they were unhelpful. This airport is to be avoided. The other airports in India that I've been to have been ok but this one is really subpar and treats their passengers, especially transit passengers very poorly. Security is also extremely picky wanting any cable or anything electronic to be taken out. It becomes very chaotic as you are separated from your belongings.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | We transited from Heathrow to Kathmandu via Delhi and returned from Kathmandu to Heathrow via the same, via Delhi’s T3. On both occasions our ‘transfer/transit experience’ was completely unacceptable, bordering on downright disgraceful. We expected the transfer to be similar to what we’d experienced at other major airports in the past, (like Heathrow, Bogotá, Lisbon), however, Delhi was an exception. On arrival, we found ourselves being ‘held’ in the ‘Transfer Area’ - were we had to wait for 2-3 hours (each way) for our tickets to be stamped. We were informed this could only be done by ‘Airline staff’ and we’d have to wait for ‘someone to come’. Hundreds of other passengers from other aircraft founds themselves having the same experience, some having waited for 5 or more hours. There isn’t ample seating, no shops, restraints or vending machines, just an area that looked and felt like an Emergency Department hospital waiting room with confused, anxious, tired and upset people waiting for ‘someone’ to stamp their boarding pass. The whole operation lacked any order, with staff behind kiosks saying ‘you have to wait’. After hours of waiting, and constantly asking, our boarding passes were initialled by the same man who’d told us to ‘wait’ and we then proceeded through a security area that seemed that it hadn’t changed in 20 years. There was no automated belt/carousel to place items on ( we all shudder our trays along a table) and ever passenger was asked to stand on an elevated wooden box (in front on 100’s waiting) whilst an ignorant security guard waved a wand, and abruptly stamped the boarding card. I can compare this 2-3 hour ‘ordeal’ to transiting at Heathrow - one of the worlds busiest airports - which took 20 minutes. If you are simply using Delhi to transit/transfer, please consider another airport. I am writing to our travel agent to ask they consider my experience, and others who’ve also documented the same on this site, so they might instead re-route their customers via another hub.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | This was by far the worst experience at an airport. We were returning back to London and allowed the usual 3hrs prior to our departure time to ensure we had some time for duty free shopping and to have some breakfast before our flight. Our flight was at 10.20am and we reached Delhi airport at 7.15am. After checking in our luggage, we joined the passport control queues. There were only 2 people serving and there was a very very long queue. After 1.5 hours it was our turn and I mentioned to the guy that you need more staff. He said they were short staffed due to some staff attending election duties. Then we spent another 1.5hrs in security. People were getting angry and shouting. We were still in the queue 10mins before our gate was about to close. They finally alert us through and we had to run to our departure gate. We had no time for shopping nor breakfast.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | The transit system through terminal 3 is the worst I have ever experienced in 30 years of travel. Transiting passengers are told to sit in a transit lounge and wait by staff who seem to have no idea and no authority to do anything. My connecting flights was 8 hours away and I already had a boarding pass for the next flight. I was therefore expecting to be able to go direct into the departure area of Terminal 3. There were many other passengers who also had boarding passes but were also told to wait. We were repeatedly told that someone was coming for us from the airline of our next flight but don't be fooled, NO-ONE is coming for you. When I asked over many hours why no-one was coming I was told that I needed to contact my airline. I told them in no uncertain terms that it was their job to contact the airline as they are the transit desk. I figured that within 1-2 hours of my flight, the flight crew of my next flight would contact the transit desk to 'release me' or come and get me. When within an hour of my flight this did not happen I once again lined up at the transit desk where no-one served me (they avoid you). With 45 min to go, I walked up to a slightly more senior man and interrupted him from his call and basically gave him a massive dressing down and warned him that I was not missing my flight because of the incompetence of the transit desk. When he realised that I was 30min from missing my flight, he hastily stamped my boarding pass and let me through. I got to my gate with 2 min to spare and was the 3rd last passenger on the flight. On my return leg through Delhi, I was told to wait once again and my transit was 10 hours. This time I immediately told the junior staff that there was no way in hell I was spending 10 hours in their lounge without food and I made sure other passenger were informed of the absence of any system. I received a meaningless stamp on my boarding pass and was let through immediately to Terminal 3. An American traveller who also caused a scene was also let through. When I went through this second time, a lady was in tears at the counter because the staff were so unhelpful.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | I am a frequent traveler (I take at least one flight every month) and this is the worst airport I have ever encountered. The staff is rude, unprofessional, and just want to make your life difficult to show that they have power over you. My partner and I landed in the airport at 12am and were transiting until our next flight at 9am. We were taken straight into a transit hall and were told we could not leave until our airline representative arrived (at 4am). We were booked on business class so we thought we could use the business lounge for the whole duration of our transit, but they would not let us leave. The transit lounge has no food and barely any water. At 4am when the airline representative finally arrived, he told us that he could not give us our boarding passes because they had lost our checked-in bags. At this point we were wondering what this had to do with us - If *they* lost our bags, why are *we* the ones having to wait in this transit lounge until they found our bags? The boarding passes were even already printed (we saw them in his hands), the representative just did not want to hand them over to us and told us to wait ""15 more mins"" and kept saying that for the next 3 hours. Only after we had caused a scene at the transfer counter (some other passengers and I were screaming at them to do their jobs), then all the employees got on their feet and started making calls to find our bags. Before that nobody made any effort to look for our bags. We met many different people in the transit area and they all had similar experiences. Others had waited way longer than us - 9 hours, 12 hours, someone had waited 3 whole days (since there was no food, the airport staff only fed her once a day.) Another passenger in the transit area who had been waiting for hours said to one staff: ""This is the worst airport and I will never transit here again"" and he flat out said to her: ""Because you said that, I will not help you."" Yes, this came from an employee, who is literally being paid to help passengers. And yes, all the employees there had the same mentality.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | From entry to check in to security to boarding its a mess, and bonus is lounge. This terminal had already crossed its maximum capacity and precovid building work of new T1 building started and till the new terminal is completed this old T1 will operate with reduced capacity still more than its reduced capacity as much area is closed for operation. When you reach the terminal 1st queue starts from entry gate, I can understand CISF checking of ticket and ID is for our safety but it should be little fast and smooth, many gates remains unmanned and long queue at operating gate. Then you enter and proceed to check in desk, this depends upon airlines but what I experienced in recent days there are hardly any support staff of airlines at check in area to manage crowd and many people were jumping queue at last moment. Then comes the most important (but unfortunately most mis managed) part which is security, very few check point operating with respect to crowd and very congested area to stand before, no chance of maintaining social distancing and after every few passenger have to call airport staff for tray, and bonus every fourth fifth person is so called late and have to jump the queue, sometime queue is so long that it can easily go till airline check in counter. After security anyone proceed to have some food at food court/stand alone restaurant or lounge or directly to boarding gate. Due to renovation food court is closed (saw they constructing new one at ground floor) so crowd at whatever places remains. There is only one lounge that is Encalm lounge ,the lounge itself is good but due to over crowding again expect a queue. After that time to board the flight and boarding area is another crowded area. Very few place to sit with respect to crowd also the airport consider it self as silent airport so no announcement, in this situation cant stay away far from gate even if no place to sit Wifi is just for name, to activate need OTP on mobile, for non Indian mobile it hardly come (but if by any chance get connected then can set pin number for next use, wont need otp, if not getting OTP then can get coupon from helpdesk but even after connecting no guarantee it would work.

Delhi,"✅ Trip Verified | Of all the 150+ airports in the world that I have used, Delhi airport is by far the worst in terms of handling passengers, let alone 'surge' periods. Despite traveling Business Class and using every privilege that I have, it took me 90 minutes to get through security and passport control. I pity others who don't have such privileges, they're bounced around in long-lines, and indefinite waiting times. Even showing up 4 hours before your flight isn't enough anymore. The first issue is with 'line-jumpers', those who brazenly disregard lines. They either are unaware, or just play dumb. There are also jumpers who jump in front of other line-jumpers, which requires you to have a sharp elbow, a cold stare, or a sharp rebuke ready and available. The second is lane discipline - there is none. Most of the people in the 'dedicated' business class lane didn't belong there, and there's no one checking if they belong there or even sending them to other lines. Essentially, everyone is everywhere, leading to total chaos. There's always the official guy (with a prominent badge, of course) who's escorting a couple of privileged people to the front of the line. Add to that airline crews, who don't bother with lines. All of the above could be handled if the airport authorities understood when surges happen; instead, there was only one passport reviewer for business class (while there could have been a max of 4). Security screening is another nightmare - those thin divider ropes are hardly respected and stops no one. In the end, we were just glad to get out of there, swearing 'never again'. On the way to the plane, a large banner reads ""Delhi Airport - voted best airport in Asia"" to rub it in.

Efforts by many pax to alarm the setup through the Information Counter failed to result in any improvement. Finally some concerned executive arrived at the belt but showed a total lack of involvement and was very reluctant to call up the luggage delivery management setup. This was very unprofessional on his part, further delaying the delivery and aggravating the disgust for the pax. Other flights were landing at regular interval thus delaying the priority for our flight. It was at least one extra hour of wait before the luggage arrived. It highlighted a dismal management of the ground duties as well as total absence of accountability, since there was no public announcement about the reason of delay to deliver the luggage nor the concerned ground staff showing any concern about the system breakdown.

Complete chaos. Then comes immigration, in normal days when there were more flights immigration was far smoother, now when there are very limited flights it took more. Reason for that was the immigration staff was updating each passengers address and mobile number which we had already updated on self declaration form before the journey, what a waste of time and man power.

Delhi,"Not Verified | Arrival: the signage at the international arrival was very unclear to not present at all. Luckily, I finally stumbled upon customs/immigration. Another passenger asked me for help on where to go for a transfer. I couldn’t help because that signage was just as vague or non-existent. Luckily there was no line at all for customs/immigration. It was very quick. Unfortunately, the agent was rude. After that, I personally really hate it when airports make you walk through a mall to get out. It’s very unpleasant after a long flight. Departure: This was an absolute mess. Luckily I had a hotel concierge to guide me where I needed to go and there were special queues for Business class travelers. Without that, I would easily have spent a half-hour just trying to figure where I needed to be. It was chaos and the signage, again, was woefully inadequate. Queuing time for Business/First Class is just fine, but it looked awful for everyone else. The customs/immigration agents were just as rude as the arrival agent. I understand that English is not their first language, but a few soft skill practices would go a long way—responding at all when I say thank you, for example. After customs/immigration is okay. However, the holding area at the departure gates is downright dehumanizing. No bathroom access? Seriously? WiFi: many people mention that you can’t access it without an India phone number via SMS. This has been fixed and US numbers work. However, the 45 minute limit is not up-to-par with the rest of the world’s airports. Overall, I would avoid this airport unless you simply have to go here.

More ever, they take their sweet time and interrogate each and every departing passenger. 99/100 times they don't have any clue about what visas you're travelling with or the complex immigration laws of other countries and it's just an extremely frustrating experience to deal with these people. I don't really understand the need for interrogating people at the airport after they have gone through the gruelling process of obtaining their visas at the embassy.

Delhi,"Not Verified | Immigration and security staff do not treat you with respect. As a frequent traveler and an Indian citizen, I am not a stranger to surly immigration and security staff at Indian airports but it seems like that the situation is not showing any signs of improving. During my last visit outside India, I had to face a barrage of meaningless questions from the immigration officer at the departure counter. I understand that it is their job but at the same time departing passengers should be treated with at least a little bit of respect. Usually the immigration officers in India do not understand various immigration laws of different countries and can make your departure really uncomfortable as you need to recite all the immigration laws in front of them.

Until my final departure I was ready to write a glowing report. Sadly my last experience was a horror story but I do not know if it is the Airport authority to blame or British Airways.

Delhi,"✅ Verified Review | Where to start, the beginning I suppose. This airport can only be described as hell on earth. I imagine this airport was created purely to antagonise the traveller. Being allowed into the airport is in itself a unique experience. The military guards on the door do at least make a passable attempt at looking like they are doing something useful. If you are lucky to get one who is fairly competent you may be through the doors in a couple of minutes. You will likely not find one though. Once at check in you will more than likely be served by someone who appears to be on work experience or may be their first day on the job. Once the 10 minutes or so has passed and you get your boarding card it may be worth double checking it. Then you have immigration. To describe it as a mental test is perhaps doing it a disservice, this is single-handedly the most infuriating immigration procedure I have gone through. Digital India is not real I tell you. If it were, the humming to himself/self satisfying smirk immigration officers wouldn't realistically be taking 10 minutes per person when the queue is all the way out to the check-in desks. To be fair once past this test of fortitude the shops are fairly decent. Although to balance I didn't expect to be haggling with Indian street merchants just to buy a few sweets for home. The endless checking of documents would make sense if they followed any kind of logical procedure. I cant honestly remember someone checking both my boarding pass and passport at the same time. Also don't leave anything in your bag that looks remotely bulky. To have to go down to security and physically verify the contents to your bag 30 minutes before departure is quite a strain. (By the way it was a head torch, one that has been with me through countless airports without issue).

Horrible WiFi in waiting area. Gauntlet starts with security. Afterwards the awful departure control, which of course is understaffed. Business and First class get a faster line. Poor you if you fly Economy. After getting through departure control you will discover that airlines are no longer allowed to operate their own lounges. Giant step backwards.

Delhi,"✅ Verified Review | Arrival: Very typical international arrivals procedure - nothing too special to speak of. On the long walk to immigration, watch out for the speedy golf carts, and remember to fill in the immigration form if you're traveling on a non-SARC passport. Departure: Very typical departure procedure for India (but will be a slightly unnerving overall experience for passengers accustomed to international airports outside of India). Two ""first world problem"" annoyances in Departures: Wi-Fi is a joke. After 45mins of free access, you're invited by Tata and DoCoMo to buy an access pass with mediocre bandwidth and minuscule total data limits. For international guests, this will be an annoyance compared with the unlimited free Wi-Fi available in most international airports. Climate control is tuned for a much higher temperature than most other international airports. For those connecting from cooler climes or who are used to standard room temperature, 23-deg C (73.4-deg F), it's going to feel warm. Overall Departures: Security begins with checkpoints and excessive numbers of traffic calmings on the road as you approach the airport, but these are more like military-manned speed bumps with no real checking taking place. You will only be allowed to enter the terminal (even just the departure hall) if you present your passport and a valid printed / electronic ticket to the armed military personnel who guard the sliding doors. Check-in counter experience is typical to most international airports, though, noticeably sluggish. Exit Immigration process can also be relatively sluggish, even with all documents and visas readily available. Immigration agents clearly don't earn bonus salary based on throughput rates. Similar to other Indian airports, the security checkpoint will likely be frustrating if you're used to the more technology-supported and less touchy-feely procedures in most other international airports. Despite removing all metal from your person and walking through a metal detector without setting off the alarm, you will be asked to stand on a box, arms out, and be swiped with a metal detector and be patted down. Though I did not personally experience it in Delhi, I saw my fellow travelers be heavily scrutinized for the contents of their bags to an extent above and beyond most other international airports (in a way similar to experiences I've had in Mumbai that felt petty and unnecessary). Be warned: you will likely receive no sympathy for items whose dimensions are near the borderline of allowed sizes. Duty-Free and shopping area are typical to most international airports. A number of shops specializing in Indian wares are dotted throughout the airport. Convenient for those last-minute pashmina purchases. Overall: The military presence throughout the airport combined with military involvement in so many aspects of the operations makes for practical and procedure-centric security protocols, but it's a clumsy and heavy-handed approach that doesn't win bonus points for customer experience.

Delhi,✅ Verified Review | Delhi Airport is nice as long as journey starts or ends here. If you are a transit passenger or travelling with children then it is very stressful. I checked in a pram at the point of boarding at LHR but the pram was not given back to us at Delhi. They don’t handover prams to transit passenger which is very strange policy. I was told that prams would be handed over at the final destination as a piece of luggage. One has to carry their child in their arms and walk long distances to the next point of boarding at this airport.

Delhi,"✅ Verified Review | Avoid this airport if at all possible. There are multiple signs around the airport that say it is rated as one of the best in the world. I would love to know who rated it so well, because this airport is run as if it were a prison. You can only move through it when they say you can. We had a 13 hour layover here due to a missed connection caused by an Indian domestic airline. We had business class tickets so we thought that at least we could comfortably spend those long hours in the business class lounge. Despite having paid thousands of dollars for business class we were told we could not access this lounge until 6 hours before our departure time. First we were held prisoners in a glass pen which had only one small kiosk with a minimal selection of food and no restrooms. To use the restrooms we had to leave the pen and go to the arrivals area. Every time we left and then re-entered this glass pen which the airport calls a ""lounge"" we had to present our passports and departure documents. Finally 6 hours before our flight time we were allowed to leave the glass pen. We then proceeded to the appropriate Indian airline Business Class departure desk. There we were told that we could not go through security (and arrive at the business class lounge) until 4 hours before flight time. To say that we were incensed is putting it mildly. Finally they agreed to allow us to advance through their prison system to the business lounge 5 hours before our flight time. The airline's ground personnel at the airport were unpleasant, unsympathetic, and unhelpful. The security officials were surly. Once we arrived at the Business Class Lounge our remaining hours in this prison called the Indira Ghandi Delhi International Airport passed smoothly. It is too bad that this airport is so highly regulated because the building is beautiful and well kept. But I will never, ever pass through this airport again.

Delhi,"✅ Verified Review | Transiting in Delhi is just a disaster. Delhi Airport auto proclaims itself the best airport (of what?), this is just even more outrageous because they are far worst than any airports I have been to. I have flown over 300000 miles per year for the past 10 years. Avoid this airport as much as you can. Arriving from Bangkok I had to transit via New Delhi on my way to Milan for business. We had to walk 2 kilometres before arriving at the transit area, where security screening was in force, which is good, only if this was not a 1 hour process with rude and unaware staff. The whole airport is just shabby because of lack of care and toilets are dirty just because they aren't cleaning it up properly. Once inside the terminal of my connecting flight, bad luck, 5 hours delay. Nothing to do with the airport but spending 5 hours in that terminal showed me the worst of it. Again, all the staff: lounge, shops, restaurants are just so impolite, rude and useless. One of the lounge staff asked me to take on a survey to rate the lounge, which I did, once completed the guy came back to me and asked me to change few of the ratings and add up more positive comments. I have asked him if it was normal to force customers to write what they want and not what they have experienced. He left without a smile. The ground staff wanted to check my passport 2 hours before boarding, I have asked why? They failed to provide a valid reason except fainting to do something useful for so much delay, I simply refused and told them I would hand out my passport once the boarding would start. Everything is over priced, we're being ripped of at every purchase. Food is so poor, come on, we're in India, choice should be large, tastes amazing! Well, get ready to have only junk food.

Delhi,"✅ Verified Review | As a frequent business traveller to India, I have been amazed at Delhi Airport claiming that it has been voted the best airport in the World. Now I note it is claiming it has been voted the best airport in the World for the second year running! I can only imagine that it must have been by the management at Delhi Airport or people that have not visited any other airport. In my opinion it offers one of the worst passenger experiences anywhere in the World. A good airport should be efficient, easy to navigate through, functional and clean – Delhi falls over on each of these points. Even transferring from the domestic to the international terminal is an experience most travellers would only want to do once. If the poor traveller can manage to find how to do this and meet the criteria to qualify for a free ticket, they are then faced with a dangerously un-roadworthy bus, a driver that seems to have won his driving license in a lottery and then have demands to part with money for having their luggage put on the bus and even a charge for each piece of luggage carried – the driver once stopped the bus and threatened to throw my wife and I off the bus if we did not pay an extra charge for each piece of luggage we had with us. The immigration process and security will have even the most mild mannered and calm traveler fuming with frustration. Then come the food outlets, poor quality, dirty and not open at the same time as the airport – try getting a cup of coffee at 5am in the morning. WiFi? Unless you have an Indian mobile number, not possible. Taxi? Firstly, for your own safety, you should take a pre-paid taxi arranged inside the terminal building. However, make sure you know exactly where you are going, because it is very unlikely the taxi driver will - last time I arrived at Delhi I was booked into the IBIS in Aerocity, which actually on the airport complex, and I had to provide directions to get the taxi there because the taxi driver had no idea where it was.

You then follow the transfer route to security which is where the fun really starts. Men and women are split into separate queues which is fine and it took me about an hour to be processed in the queue I had joined. It appeared that the metal detector 'gates' weren't functioning properly so each passenger had to be screened by a hand held detector. The was conducted in a thorough manner as is expected but only one individual member of the security staff was doing this. About 7 or 8 other security staff were either standing around talking or staring at a hand luggage x-ray machine, only one of which appeared to be working. Frequently, hand luggage was stopped from going through because it contained either a laptop or a camera so the offending item needed to be removed adding further delay. It didn't appear to have occurred to the staff to display a sign instructing these items to be removed first. Having got through security, I proceeded to the departure gate for my onward flight to London which was now showing a one hour delay. There I joined a small queue to enter the gate area where yet again, an airline official closely examined my boarding card and passport and then allowed me to enter the gate area. After about 20 minutes, all those who had entered the gate area with me were instructed to leave it and yes you've guessed it, join an extremely long queue that had formed in order to go through the whole process of re-entering the gate area by once again having my boarding card and passport examined yet again.

No easy way to get luggage into the packed bus. We eventually end up taking a taxi. On our way back we avoid the airport transfer by choosing a domestic airline that lands in T3. But this time we were not allowed to enter the check-in area because we were an hour too early and were held in a small cramped up staging area.

Delhi,"Overall, our experience at the airport was extremely negative. We arrived at the international terminal (T3) around 2.30am and had to transit to domestic terminal (T1) to catch a domestic flight at 6.30am. With 3.5 hours in between our international arrival and domestic flight, we assumed that we would be able to catch the domestic flight, but unfortunately we missed our domestic connection. The bad experience started with a bus-transfer from T3 to T1 which took over 1hr 20min from the time we exited customs to the time we arrived at the check-in counter in the domestic terminal. Not only that, the bus driver ended up asking us (and other passengers) for money and when we refused to pay, he threatened to drop us off the bus, this inter-terminal connection is supposed to be free. The check-in process was slow due to a long line, and since the baggage allowance was lower on the domestic flight, it was made even slower as we had to go into another line to pay the extra baggage fee before check-in. The whole check-in took slightly over 40min. Security took another 30 mins. At the end of this endless queues and waiting, we arrived at the departure gate about 15 min prior to flight's scheduled departure, but the airlines have a policy of closing the gate 30 mins before departure so we were not allowed to board the flight. Exiting the post-security departure to go back to check-in counter to rebook on to later flight was another strange story. One would expect that we could walk back to the check-in area, but that isn't the case. You have to be escorted by an airline official who will first gather many passengers that have missed their flights, walk them to the security area (the same security checkpoint that one stands in line before the departure gates), and write down the passengers details one by one manually in a notebook before letting you go. Once in the check-in area, we managed to rebook onto a later flight by different airline, but still had to wait another 45 mins before we could get our luggage back from the airline who flight we had missed. In other words, from the time we missed the flight to the time that we received our luggage was another 1hr15 mins, and then we had to go through the same checkin/pay extra luggage/security before we could board onto another flight. By the time we got on our domestic flight, it had been a total of 6+ hours since we had landed in T3 terminal. We hadn't sat down for a single moment in all this time, and had been under constant stress of moving in different queues or waiting on/for something. Our experience at Delhi airport was in sharp contrast to our smooth sailing at Shanghai airport (we were flying into Delhi from Shanghai). We had a total of 4 hours at Shanghai airport.

Delhi,"It is amazing how many people criticise this airport for things that are essentially out of its control and have nothing to do with the airport but everything to do with the country's policy. Not being allowed in to the airport without your ticket is a nationwide policy, not just restricted to Delhi Airport. Having all of your hand baggage tagged is a nationwide policy, not unique to Delhi airport, and people giving the airport a poor rating for this are being unfair if not incorrect. The heavy security, and inability to enter the airport more than 6 hours before your flight are nationwide issues as per the policy of the Indian Government, and not specific to Delhi Airport. Terminal (T3) - In general the terminal is clean, the check in and immigration is smooth and efficient. Security check can be sometimes be slow, sometimes very speedy depending on when your flight is leaving. If you're departing after 10 pm Friday/Saturday, you will pretty much get a huge rush at the airport, and security will be a bottleneck. At most other times, things run so efficiently that it seems like this huge airport is empty all the time, but that is not the case. It is just very good at processing people through it. Departure area has many shops including an electronics shop and multiple clothing stores offering reasonable prices. The food is so-so but there are a few choices there. Arrival is equally smooth, with multiple immigration counters, a great duty free and very fast baggage claim. Outside the terminal yes, things are chaos - but that's India, not the airport. To magically expect people to learn traffic rules as soon as they approach the airport when they have no idea about them otherwise is a little foolish. Terminal 1 (T1) - This is the domestic terminal which caters specifically to low-cost airlines only, and is therefore built accordingly. To those who are unaware, this terminal was meant to be demolished, and all traffic was meant to go through T3, however, they decided to retain the building as it was perfectly functional, although it is now over capacity.

Delhi,"I use this airport frequently and standards seem to have slipped of late. The airport on the whole is great but security staff can be rude and daunting. I was not aware of this 6 hour prohibition of entry before a flight. Like at most third world airports everyone gives a different answer. Staff are helpful but not very professional or organised. It is true that not every staff member is well informed. Keep an eye on the display board for flight timings. I have never experienced erroneous displays leading to missed flights. You should know your flight timings and arrive at the boarding gate in good time avoid missing your flight. Only a fool would wait for a final call announcement over the PA system. However Airline staff would do well to announce delays. My Emirates flight was once delayed for 2 hours hours and the Emirates staff did not bother to show it on the board IGI also needs more flight info screens and for those driving to the city a petrol pump to gas up for the drive to the city.

If you are provided with a transfer boarding card at the check in counter what do you do? Obviously you go to transit lounge and wait for your flight. But no not here. If you show your transfer boarding card here they simply say that it will not work here. They think boarding cards issued by them are the only ones valid. Getting this boarding card is not easy. During my last trip I had a 12 hour long flight to Delhi and had 6 hour of transit at Delhi and my small 1.5 years old daughter was not feeling well but because of above issues I had to wait for 3 hours just to reach the transit lounge.

Delhi,Arrived here from Dublin via Abu Dhabi. A week later departed on domestic flight to Goa. Then arrived and transited to flight back to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. When we landed it took a while with the bus to get to terminal. It was early morning in winter so wasn't too hot fortunately. A few flights seemed to have arrived at same time so there was a long queue at immigration. But there were plenty of staff working and they were very polite. Domestic terminal for flight to Goa was a little chaotic. But terminal is bright and clean. Security is heavy but understandable. Good range of cafes in domestic terminal. On return transited from domestic to international terminals. Quite a long distance. Had to wait a long time for bus and it was very cold outside. International terminal was very pleasant experience. We arrived there at 11pm and our flight wasn't until 4am. But we were able to check in early and go through security. Duty free shops had a great selection and very cheap. Walking distances were short enough within the terminals as well. Overall a pleasant experience.

Delhi,I have started most of my international journeys through this airport. After having visited several international hubs (LHR CDG DXB AUH SIN HKG BKK KUL CMB) I have to rate Terminal 3 of Delhi Airport one of the best among them. This is a busy airport in terms of flight and passenger volume. Despite this I have never seen this airport very crowded be it check-in counters immigration desk security channel or boarding gates. This is due to the fact that the terminal is very spacious. It has a large number of check-in counters immigration desks and boarding gates. The airport is ultra-modern and very clean. The interiors are great and no less than the interiors of Terminal 3 LHR Terminal 2 SIN or DXB. They have sufficient number of restaurants duty free shops. You are never short of seats once you clear immigration. I hate its traffic which makes the flights wait for longer during take off and keep hovering in air for some time during landing. I think they need to make additional runways functional. Another bad thing about this airport is for transit passengers. If you are transiting through this airport to another destination you may not get proper guidance from staff for new boarding gates. This is mostly to Air India passengers as this airport is the transit hub for Air India.

Delhi,Transit Lounge B of the international terminal - you will sit and wait interminably for someone to take pity on you and issue you your boarding pass for your next flight.

Two three hour waits are normal in a lounge bereft of anything in the way of amenities except for a vending machine.

Delhi,This relates to T3. We arrived International with a Domestic Connection. Immigration queues were short and did not take as long as last year our baggage arrived reasonably quickly but in order to catch our T3 domestic flight (same terminal) we had to go landside recheck in our bags and then go through landside security. This is stupid and takes a long time - why do they not have airside connections to Domestic we wonder? Hence the three hours connection time we had was only just enough.

Delhi,DEL T3 is much better than what they had before. It is certainly more pleasant although the carpet color and design seems a bit too loud. The lines did seem a bit longer but nothing that one shouldn't expect. Airport seems to have more choices in terms of restaurants but unfortunately the prices are blatantly high. That is something that they should seriously look at. I think they are using international standards when it comes to pricing. Sadly that is not quite the same when it comes to customer service. I still found washrooms well below par and there were pigeons flying around inside the terminal. If you haven't used DEL before make sure you take the print out of your ticket with you otherwise you will not be allowed inside the terminal. Seems like DEL is the only airport to do that.

Delhi,In transit from LHR to BKK with Air India. Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge).

Delhi,Delhi has a nice airport. However make sure you arrive 3 hours before departure. Check in and security checks can take time. Its been Delhi's bane for years. If you need to exchange rupees for foreign currency the choice is not wide and limited mostly to USD and EUROs. There is a Thomas Cook counter close to the entrance and a short walk from check in areas. The airport needs ATMs and Bureau de Change kiosks in the transit and departure lounge following immigration and security. Do not carry a stash of Indian Rupees unless you need to spend it at the airport and exchange them for foreign currency before you go through immigration and security. Or else you could get stuck with Indian rupees on your way out. The Airport seriously needs to think of ATMs and more forex counters in the departure and transit area. Also a Reliance webworld like the one at the old T2 will help. Printers and copiers will be nice too. Surprisingly there is no Business centre at this airport. Very strange. Delhi is slowly getting to be a transit airport so these facilities are called for. The train service to New Delhi railway station is good too. The departure area offers luggage storage for a nominal fee. If you are transiting to the domestic terminal( Low cost carrier terminal which is a few Kms from T3) make sure you have a minimum of 4 hours between flights. Travel to the domestic terminal and queuing at the domestic terminal can eat up a good 2 hours That said IGI Airport is a good airport to travel through.

Delhi,"The best airport in India I have been to there is no bus transfer from domestic to international like BOM still has. Security checks are plenty the cabin luggage screening is a huge mess with shoving and pushing from all sides it is not clear how efficient these checks are and what the purpose of funny paper tags with a stamp on every bag is. If they are so important why are only 2 of our 4 bags actually checked at the time of boarding. Immigration is equally confusing. You are supposed to fill a form nobody tells you that you have to fill it and the form is not available anywhere. Same thing happens when you try to leave the country - you have to plea to a number of staff to actually find out the secret of which other staff member is hiding the forms. The form to leave the country again needs the same information as you gave for the visa application. The Immigration officer then told me it was the duty of the airline to hand out these forms. International to domestic luggage is not checked through even though this was confirmed to me at the time of check-in in BKK by Air India staff. Leaving India it was checked through as well as for international to international transfer. To recheck you bags you have to pick them up and walk them all across the building to some dedicated transfer counters. While walking in the terminal make sure not to stumble over the large gaps in the floor. I was also surprised to find large amounts of staff in washrooms that are labelled ""not for staff"" they are mostly passing time and chatting away.

Delhi,First of all I must mention that T3 is an enormous improvement on the old terminal. It is well laid out and very spacious. I'm not sure about the brownish carpet throughout though! With a few improvements mainly in attitudes it might one day achieve the status of some of the better airports like Singapore although I'm not holding my breath. First of all immigration and security staff need to learn manners. Security staff in particular are incompetent and surly. Secondly toilet attendants need to attend to their cleaning duties instead of hovering about trying to extract tips. Thirdly WiFi needs to be free. There is supposed to be free WiFi for 30 minutes. However the PIN code was not fully sent to my mobile phone and as a result I was not able to log on either at the time of my first visit or upon my return visit a fortnight later.

The security queues at international transfer was really long and as well as the queue for lift to domestic transfers.

Delhi,Terminal 3. Beautiful big efficient airport that works well except for one fatal flaw: the security arrangement in the transit zone. I strongly encourage anyone thinking of flying a route that involves connecting in Delhi to avoid this airport altogether by finding another route. It is massively inefficient slow incompetent and aggravating. The worst airport security set-up I've experienced except for Heathrow Terminals 3 and 4 in London which come a close second. It is under-staffed poorly designed and the people working there are obviously poorly motivated have poor technical training no common sense and no understanding about how to treat passengers like human beings.

Delhi,I was in Delhi Airport in December and January and both experiences were great. Upon arrival from BKK I walked to Passport control and waited about 10 minutes before being cleared. I was impressed with the new terminal (T3). Upon leaving India in January I arrived at the front doors greeted by an armed guard asking for my flight itinerary. I did not have it printed but I showed it to him on my iPhone and had absolutely no issues getting in. Checking in was a breeze and passport control/security was fine. Took about 20-25 minutes to get through so make sure you are there at least 2 hours before in order to get to your plane on time. Once I cleared security I was amazed. This new terminal is like nothing I have seen. Huge beautiful design clean (which is rare in India) a lot of shops and eateries everywhere and very nice staff.

Delhi,You need time and patience on this airport plan a lot of time to make your change here. Very important even if you are checked in online you need to get in a line for your boarding pass because your airline is not allowed to let you print out your document. I was told the check-in closes 2 hours before departure I don't know I arrived 25 hours before. When your hand luggage has been screened you get a stamp on your luggage/hand luggage/airline sticker with the date. This stamp will checked before you get on the plane. If you do not have this you are in trouble. So after security you should check your sticker/leaf for the stamp. And you need to get in the line many times. Without air ticket you are not allowed to enter the terminal. For the whole building there are 4 old blind men to check this documents. Imagine how fast this is. Then check is line immigration line security line enter the waiting room designated for your flight than one more old soldier who checks the stamps. I was lucky I did not find any crowd at any time.

Mumbai,"Not Verified | I travelled with my mom, who is a senior citizen to Mumbai. We arrived in Mumbai at approximately 2:30 am on 30 January 2025. At customs control there were no ground staff to supervise and assist passengers as to which lines they should queue in. They ran out of the customs forms and the print quality of the forms was pathetic. After collecting our luggage we proceeded to the exit. Since the wifi does not work for foreigners (Foreigners must be made aware of this as it is a risk since one has no way of contacting the hotel/driver), I left my mom near the exit with our luggage and proceeded to exit the terminal to look or our driver since there was no way of contacting him. When I tried to enter the building again to collect my mom, I was rudely chased away by a security person stationed at the door. I tried to explain the situation and he rudely and aggressively told me to leave. Fortunately my driver located me and I explained to him what happened. He tried to intervene and speak to this person but the official disgracefully refused to listen. Eventually the other official who was standing there intervened and told this official in vernacular (have compassion - she is a female). The officer then accompanied me to my mom and produced our passports and boarding pass. He tried to defend the actions of this colleague stating that its their job. My response to him was, do your job, but do it properly with respect. My question is, is this the modern age Indian values of how guests are treated in the country?

This Airport boasts a world class facility but unfortunately, is literally like a hub of scam, systematic loot, and fleecing of passengers.

The arrival experience was also quite good and I was out of the airport within one hour of arriving at the international flight. I remain a bit mystified by the habit of scanning handbags of all passengers on arrival after immigration and baggage collection which I have rarely experienced at other airports in the world.

At the same time other4 windows are running in peaceful manner for 10 businesses class people or diplomats.

Mumbai,"✅ Trip Verified | I arrived 3:10 pm with my wife at Mumbay airport Terminal 2 coming from Kochi/Kerala with IndoGo Airlines flight-# 6E184 for getting Covid-19 repatriation flight on July 11th 2:50 am with Lufthansa to Frankfurt. We were following the given airport-advice and came 4 hours prior to departure time at the departure entrance area. The complete entrance area was empty except entrance-no. 8 where we found a huge waiting queue of approximately 500 people waiting for entrance to the airport. We found out that the reason for this huge queue was a required and twice filled-in personal data formsheet each passenger had to fill-in and in addition a Covid-19-temperature-check and a passport control. The complete waiting time for us was 1 1/2 hours before we were allowed to enter the check-in area inside the area. Although all other entrance gates to the airport were empty all passengers were forced to use gate 8 and later also gate 7. Nobody of the airport officials informed any passenger before that the personal-data sheet is required at the entrance and as a result the entrance was permanently blocked by passenger filling-in the data at the latest moment. This procedure was obviously ordered intentionally in order the prevent too many passengers to enter the airport in a short time period. Instead of letting the passenger in for waiting in social-distanced queues inside the big empty and air conditioned departure area the responsible authorities have decided to relocate the problem outside into he heat and occupying the passenger by filling-in useless personal-data-papers which contents could have as well easily obtained by the airlines or/and the immigration authorities. I have a now a comparison of the airport situation of 1989 when I arrived at Bombay airport for the first time and the situation of today. The main difference is certainly the todays modern architecture of the building.

Then, suddenly, it seemed, the line was separated into two lines: split by gender. As the number of passengers swelled, both gender lines again separated into four or five, spread across a wide area. My wife and I completely lost sight of each other as we trudged onward to where the other people in line seemed to be headed. As we approached the checkpoint where the trays with personal belongings, electronic gadgets, belts and hand baggage are to be put on the belt/rollers to the X-ray machine, there were no instructions (as at other Indian airports), and each airport is slightly different) as to what went where. So we took our best guess and separated or metal belongings, electronics, etc. and proceeded to the line(s) now forming to go through the metal detector and pat-down/frisk area. The pat-down (which all passengers are subjected to) is ridiculously intrusive, with repeated frisking of the same area of the body. In most airports, this then concludes the security procedure. But not at Mumbai - there is one more checkpoint where your passport and boarding pass is stamped to validate your leaving the country. The area between the security pat-down and the departure validation line is so big that it is completely possible to lose your travelling companion or spouse or kids (e.g. a teenage daughter travelling with her father) in the various clusters of people. Furthermore, it is also possible that one person would wait after the exit from security and the other might assume that their companion has already proceeded to the next line. I spent close to 4 -5 minutes searching for my wife. When we finally exited the departure checkpoint into the duty-free/retail/food court area, we felt too exhausted to consider any purchases, food or drink. So grabbing our bottled water, we walked to our gate and collapsed into a couple of chairs. We had arrived at least two hours before the flight, yet, we were only 10 minutes away from boarding when we got to the gate.

The security and immigration lines are the place of extraordinary inefficiency, it is like they don’t want you to ever come back. Excruciatingly slow. When you are through all that, the relatively calm and spacious airport, with fairly good food and shopping options, gives away to the final test. The departure gate is always a total mess, even though they do it multiple times a day, with plenty of huddles by staff, gesticulating, late playing of queuing signs, switching of said signs and causing mass chaos, it is a total nightmare.

Mumbai,"✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai is my hometown. However, I am extremely disappointed with the airport and it's service. 1. Firstly, the cleanliness of toilets in the airport is extremely bad. 2. Why have a WiFi connection in the airport when you need your phone number to generate an OTP to connect to it? People in the international terminal need access to WiFI only because they do not have access to a mobile phone connection. Isn't this something logical? There's another option to connect to the WiFi if someone doesn't have access to a mobile phone by contacting an agent at the airport. There are no directions about how to find these agents; are they assigned to a particular kiosk? Overall, this is absolutely disappointing that such a major airport does not provide free WiFi to its guests upon arrival. If you really want people to verify their identify to connect to the WiFi, then here are two simple solutions: a. Have them use their ticket number/Booking confirmation as a proxy for verification to connect to the WiFi b. If you have issues with providing free WiFi connection to guests at the airport for extended periods of time, maybe provide guests with the option of using WiFi free for 30 minutes. In this time, people can gain access to other ways (email) of getting an OTP or verification code to connect to the internet. I would think that these things would naturally occur to airport staff, and such provisions will be made for guests especially at an international terminal. When other airports, both in the country and outside have implemented these simple solutions, why is this not implemented in ""one of the best airports in the world?"" 3. Ridiculously long wait times at customs. Maybe try increasing the number of outlets at customs? 4. Supper inefficient and rude ground staff at baggage claim. I was waiting in line for 15 minutes below a board that said ""XYZ"" airlines at the baggage services only to find out that this queue was not dedicated to that particular airline. Here's a question: Why have such a big display board in the wrong place? I was standing in front of an agent for 5 minutes with no response from this person. I had to attract this person's attention from a distance of 5 feet to be able to get my questions answered. This person wouldn't even acknowledge the fact that someone was standing in front of them.

Mumbai,"✅ Trip Verified | With so many ""digital"" engineers lurking in the undergrowth, why are Indian airports such frustrating experiences? Many reviews of Mumbai (BOM in old money) have been seduced by the modern architecture of Terminal 2, and the availability of shops and food outlets (who sting you at European high-street prices). But what is the key performance function of an airport? Surely to flow passengers and their baggage in two opposite directions: kerbside to aircraft and aircraft to kerbside? Everything else is just icing. And in this, BOM fails miserably. Is it the quality of the staff employed and the quality of their training? Possibly! Is it the complete lack of accountability of the leadership, both the management and the government authorities who lay down the rules? I suggest these are more likely culprits. On arrival at the immigration desks after a long, overnight flight from London, it was clear that the counters were inadequately staffed. Did anyone with a leadership role care? Could they do something about it if they did? I doubt it on both counts. I felt sorry for the font-line staff who were trying to cope. There were several categories of queues: Indian citizens, OCI/PIO card holders, Diplomats, and also desks for wheel-chaired passenger all of which were closed. Closed, even though Mumbai seems to have more than the average number of passengers with mobility problems. As a result, people managing the queues were trying to move passengers from one queue to another as that category built up. A course in queuing theory for the leadership might help, but only if they then understood the need to stay in touch with, and have a visceral knowledge of how to improve the passenger flows through their airport.",2.0,0,Solo Leisure,Arrival Only,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2018.0,trip verified many digital engineers lurking undergrowth indian airports frustrating experiences many reviews mumbai bom old money seduced modern architecture terminal availability shops food outlets sting european highstreet prices key performance function airport surely flow passengers baggage two opposite directions kerbside aircraft aircraft kerbside everything else icing bom fails miserably quality staff employed quality training possibly complete lack accountability leadership management government authorities lay rules suggest likely culprits arrival immigration desks long overnight flight london clear counters inadequately staffed anyone leadership role care could something doubt counts felt sorry fontline staff trying cope several categories queues indian citizens ocipio card holders diplomats also desks wheelchaired passenger closed closed even though mumbai seems average number passengers mobility problems result people managing queues trying move passengers one queue another category built course queuing theory leadership might help understood need stay touch visceral knowledge improve passenger flows airport,-0.7184,Negative,Indian

Mumbai,"✅ Verified Review | I will never travel to Mumbai Airport again. The security process for transit passengers is repeatedly traumatic. On the latest egregious occasion, it took 40 minutes to an hour to get through the security checkpoint, which was complete chaos after at least 150 passengers from five different flights were stuck there, some almost having nervous breakdowns at the prospect of missing their flights - which probably happens often! Why? 1)There are sections for men and women, but within those sections there is no clear system of queues or no ropes or tapes to guide everyone, such that everyone herds around the conveyor belt, before forming another mass around the sole operating full body scanner for women. The security officer behind the curtained section takes her sweet time, too. Why not double your staff immediately when you see giant queues forming? 2) You place your things on the conveyor belt and have to form a separate queue before the body scanner. Often this means that your things will be scanned way ahead of you and will be sitting there at the opposite end of the X-ray machine, unattended. This is illogical. What if you leave a wallet or a laptop there for 40 minutes while you wait to get through the scanner? What's to stop someone from taking them? 3) This also means that the terrible X-ray security staff cannot match belongings to their owner immediately when they spuriously decide to do further inspections. There's a cattle call at the end of the conveyor belt (if by some miracle you get through!) asking the security staffer to please send along the bags or at least inform the owner if their bag needs to be inspected further. This does not happen. Recently my bag had to be checked five times. Each time, it was not disclosed what I needed to show or take out. I was accused of bringing a lighter. I don't even smoke. Hoping he had some semblance of reason, I asked the officer to open my entire bag if he wanted to double-check that I did not have a lighter. All he said was ""take out your lighter."" Again, I did not have a lighter. He then proceeded to let it go through the X-ray two more times. How is this an efficient system? It is a complete nightmare! Moreover, isn't this system precluding paying fliers from enjoying the revamped airport and shopping or dining at restaurants, contributing to profits? 4. Speaking to the airline I flew with, staff at the airport are completely aware of the problem with transit security. But nothing is being done by the airport authority. It should look to airports that handle crowding well, like Hong Kong airport or even Charles de Gaulle in Paris, which is where we traveled from.

Mumbai,"✅ Verified Review | Yes, the international terminal is a great improvement on the old one, but although the architecture is 21st Century, the security processes strictly Victorian. Trundle up to the main entrances and you will find one policeman (perhaps two during the rush hour) checking your passport and boarding pass before you are let into the building. The checking process takes about 30 seconds per passenger, the policeman giving the impression he has not does this before. The lengths of queues seem not to matter as there are several colleagues lounging around doing nothing. Baggage check-in was quick and efficient, but the security checks before being allowed air-side were also Victorian: compare the throughput of, say, Gatwick to Mumbai to see how inefficient the process is. And in the land that is supposed to be the global centre for software development! What makes matters worse is that very little help is provided to the many first-time travellers, young men going off to work in the Middle East.

Check-In is a breeze with the airline check-in counter numbers clearly displayed as you drive through. Security Clearance is swift too.

Mumbai,"✅ Verified Review | While Terminal 2 of the Mumbai International Airport is new and much improved in services, there is now one big shortcoming which is quite irritating whenever arriving. The arrivals are on floor 6 and car park is on floor 5. A simple ramp could have easily made passengers arriving on 6th floor to move quickly to 5th floor where cars are being parked. However the process is quite trying and agonising. One has to wait for the lift most of the time which are occupied by passengers going upto the 10th floor for departures or people coming down from the 10th floor after seeing off their guests. Add to the problem is there only one way to enter and exit lifts which is so messy unlike the entry on one side and exit on the other side which is the feature common in many airports that makes mobility easier. Its jostling crowd in the lifts with luggage carts going upto departures at 10th floor and passengers are trying to get into the lifts even those going up lest they do not miss the lift that will come down later. A very unpleasant experience for an international airport. Once I saw a couple of lifts on repair and what is left out is utter chaos and disorder taking nearly 20 t0 30 minutes for coming from 6th floor to 5th floor which if a ramp could have been provided passengers can glide through very smoothly and undisturbed.

Mumbai,"So, the relatively new Mumbai airport terminal 2 (inaugurated in 2014), mainly used for international flights is beyond par excellence in some sense at least when compared to other Indian airports (haven't yet used the well renowned IGI Airport Terminal 3). Extremely fancy, swish and glamorous, giving you a very good feel both in departure and arrival. Infused with Indian art and cultural elements, it is beyond doubt an architectural marvel. When it comes to service however, it seriously needs improvement. The queues at passport control (when fully-staffed) move at a snail's pace. They could have more trained staff handling this kind of stuff. Again, go through passport control and you enter even more beautifully designed parts of the airport and airline ground staff is especially efficient with getting their passengers on the flight due to this new 'silent-airport' policy in place. I don't really know how much of a good thing that is. I guess time will tell. One particularly frustrating thing was not being able to make a local call once I entered the airport (I don't own an Indian SIM card). There were swanky telephone booths all across the terminal, and you needed something like a pay card to access them which were apparently available at the Info Desk (I didn't consider using my credit card as minimum payment was INR 100 and I didn't need to spend more than 10-20 as I was calling within Mumbai). This involved me going all the way back across the terminal to buy this card and they didn't end up having it because of some miscommunication. The man at the desk wasn't very supportive either. Connecting through WiFi was impossible if you didn't have an Indian number because you can only connect to it when you receive a password through their portal which requires entering an Indian number (at an International airport?).

Mumbai,"My recent trip to the UAE took me and my wife through Mumbai's newest aviation landmark, Terminal 2 or T2. For passengers who have been through the ordeals of the older Sahar terminal, T2 comes in as a major relief. In terms of its architecture, facilities, floor space and shopping areas, T2 beats its predecessor in all the areas significantly. Check-in counters for respective airlines have been allocated specific entry gates to avoid any confusion. The number of check-in counters have grown exponentially and took us about 15 minutes to clear ours. As a lot of people have now understood the importance of online check-in, the queue at those counters are longer than the conventional ones. About 3-4 minutes walk later, you enter a spacious security hold area. We took under 5 minutes to clear the security and proceeded towards an almost empty immigration area. Since, Mumbai handles its bulk of international operations at night time, immigration is quite a breeze during afternoon. Fortunately, we came across a jovial immigration officer, who cleared us within 5 minutes. Post immigration, CSIA T2 is a different world altogether with big enough duty free area, restaurants and ample seating area to take a nap. Some of the other stores at the aiport are quite expensive, so try to shop at duty free or outside the airport area. The walk to the gates is quite long, but travelators at intervals glide you easily to the gates. T2 is in the process of completing its second pier of gates on their northern side, post which it will be able to handle more flights. Our arrival at T2 was that of a displeasure, as the queuing time for stamping of passports was excrutiating. Posting of more people of counters would have helped, but they didn't budge. Baggage took eons to arrive at the belt, with bags thrown on top of each other. It was a serious discomfort for the elderlies to lift their baggage from the belt. If you plan to arrive at T2 and have to arrange for a transport by yourself, please make sure that you do so before leaving the terminal building at the transportation level, as you wont be allowed to enter the building again.

Mumbai,"I have used this aiport 3 times in the last 2 years. It's a huge improvement over the old airport. On first arriving from abroad it looks glittering and new, but getting inside one sees the flaws. The walk from the aircraft to immigration is too long and the moving walkways are few and improperly placed. The carpeting on this never ending walk is not conducive to roll along luggage - it takes quite an effort pulling it along. The orange and red carpeting has a ghastly visual end result and makes it look dirty and shabby. The walk to immigration takes you through the duty free shops in an attempt to make you shop, but only succeeds in causing chaos and congestion. On departing, the terminal has a communcal check-in system, where all passengers of certain airlines have to queue irrespective of their flight times or destinations. This does not make any sense as staff keep coming around and announcing that passengers departing on flights leaving in the next 60-90 mins please move to other counters. I had a flight to Canada departing at 1.30 am, but was still stuck in the line until 12.30 because the counter staff suddenly left and from 12 counters open we were down to 4. I was finally cleared with only 45 mins remaining to get through immigration and reach my departure gate. There is not enough immigration counters / staff and the attitude is poor. The food courts does not have enough international variety, the food is very expensive and the staff seem inexperienced.

Mumbai,Just got back from a trip to Europe flying through Mumbai where we had to change planes both on Jet Airways. Both times we went through the airport the security screening process for transit passengers was a nightmare. Even though we were already checked in for our connecting flight and had boarding passes we were required to exchange them for new boarding passes at the Jet Airways counter just adjacent to the security screening point. The lines were very disorganized people crowding and pushing and all staff involved both at the airlines counters and the security point were extremely slow - moving at a snails pace.

Mumbai,"Been flying in and out of the new Mumbai Terminal for the last couple of times and I have to admit its a beautiful structure. It has plenty of personality and artwork so instagramers and the like can be happy - if you could upload the pics (more on that later). Staff have improved over the years but I still find them to be inept in a lot of ways. Mercifully the asking for tips phenomenon has largely abated but occasionally you will find the odd greedy man/woman prodding you in hushed tones for a tip. Food court is good - albeit a bit overpriced - Asian Indian junk food pub grub. Its pretty much covered. Toilets were clean and functional and toilet staff have always been polite. My only gripe so far and in the recent months has been the constant stagnating immigration queues at departures. It seems like they do not have additional staff to service the peak hours overload which is disappointing. My senior citizen parents however were quickly ushered to a different queue when we requested quick assistance. WiFi is an issue and for the life of me I couldn't get it work on my cellphone. A working sim is required for registration and with the security concerns India faces I guess I understand. Its frustrating nonetheless.

Mumbai,Flew on BA to London with young family on the 2.30am departure. Flown the route countless times but first time from the new terminal. Aside from the ubiquitous queue and paperwork check to get into the terminal this airport is one of the best in the world. The terminal building is simply stunning both from the outside and inside. The ceiling and columns are mind blowing. BA Silver status enabled sofa check-in whereby all paperwork is carried out whilst seated away from the crowds on a quiet sofa. This then led to a separate business class security check (the staff assisted us so we could keep the children asleep) and immigration. Upon entering the duty free area it is like any of the top airports in the world with an impressive variety of shops restaurants bars boutiques and bars - all neatly laid out. The signage and announcements are very clear and precise - it sounds like they hired the same lady who announces in Heathrow T5. What set the airport apart was the stunning Indian art work - great to see India showcasing indigenous art and culture and adding a personal touch when compared to the many bland and functional airports around the world. The GVK lounge is shared and has more than enough comfy seats a wide variety of local and imported alcohol as well as Indian and international food.

Mumbai,This airport has plenty of pros and cons. I was visiting India for two weeks with a group of friends flew in here from Newark on 23 June and flew out early on 5 July. Flying in was relatively painless. It was a bit hot inside the terminal but considering that this is India that's to be expected. At least the terminal does have AC. Passport control and customs were fairly efficient and the wait to get our bags wasn't that bad either. My only complaint would be the wifi. More on that later. So overall this looked like a pretty good airport flying in. Very beautiful terminal nice staff short lines. Seems like a decent airport. Flying out is where this airport can turn into a nightmare if you're not prepared. If you're planning on flying out of this airport have a copy of your flight itinerary on you or you won't even be allowed in the front door. Also if security decides to do a 'random' screening on you expect to get delayed by 30-45 minutes. Also be warned that this airport does have a second security screening at the gate. After security though the shopping selection is amazing. However the wifi here is practically useless. Sure it's there but it's very poorly thought out. First off it requires you to enter your mobile number as a login. Then you have to enter a security code which the system will text to your mobile number in order to connect. This defeats the purpose of 'free' wifi if you ask me. Anyway the system is likely broken as I used 3 different numbers with international texting and did not receive a text from the system. In the end I just gave up. Pros: Short lines Spectacular terminal Nice staff Great shopping selection Good signage. Cons: Bumbling and bureaucratic security. Second security check at gate.

Went through an extremely slow security check only to find myself stuck in a never ending customs/immigration lineup. Even after having over 30 immigration counters (half of them were unmanned) the number of counters as well as the efficiency of customs official is not sufficient to handle the out-flowing crowd. Most of the people in crowd were in verge of missing their flight. The airport authorities must be already aware of the backlog created due to all international flights departing at almost same time before the commissioning this airport - yet unable to fix this flaw. I almost made it to the departure gate half an hour before flight only to find another security checkup before boarding the plane. The flight got delayed by an hour.

Mumbai,After traveling through quite a few countries in the last few months the new international T2 terminal of the Mumbai airport seemed extremely impressive at first. It is a great architectural feat with very impressive interior deco and a collection of artwork that almost makes it look like a museum. The toilets were also quite clean. The transfer from the international to the domestic is a nightmare with exceptionally long and slow-moving security lines. Also if you are not flying Jet Airways or Indian Airlines you have to go out and take a taxi to the domestic terminals because the other domestic airlines haven't bothered to set up counters in the international arrivals area and the security there doesn't let you transfer without checking in your luggage first. The behavior and attitude of security officials is usually horrible. I arrived at a less busy time - which meant that at least the immigration was smooth.

Mumbai,Having holidayed in Goa for over 20 years I have seen many changes to the airports. This is one of the better ones. When we visited at the beginning of March the building had only been opened for 15 days so yes there were teething troubles. When everything is finished and all the shops are up and running I think this will be a gorgeous airport. I agree with previous comments regarding the staff they are definitely friendlier. Not sure what people would like done about the mosquitoes you can't put anything through the air condition as it could affect people with breathing difficulties. Just make sure you use plenty of protection. As far as security is concerned I don't care how many times I am checked at least I know I am safe.

Mumbai,I must say I disagree with the previous comments: Mumbai T2 is a huge improvement to the old terminal and we had no problems arriving 1st March around 5am and departing 8th March around 7am with TK. Immigration was quick with a very friendly officer and our bags were out too quickly - it took us some time to admire the new terminal building with pieces of Indian art that is so different from Delhi IGI or Chennai Anna International. Departure was a similar story: some queues were there but moved relatively quickly friendly check-in (TK) very friendly officers that even joked with us at security with the usual stamps here and there and finally a quick cup of coffee close to the gate before boarding. True: there are mosquitoes in T2 and not all shops are operational yet but all we needed for departure was relatively prompt & pleasant and we enjoyed the huge improvement that has taken place in Mumbai. When they shift all domestic flights to T2 towards the end of 2014 we won't hesitate to use BOM again for our travels to India.

At the new Mumbai airport we still needed to show our passport and boarding pass every 50 feet plus handbag scanning. Don't know what they are trying to prove.

The queue to check into my flight was horrendous staff at the counter were slow and staff watching the lines didn't try to reroute passengers to make things more efficient. Security was the worst I have seen. 5 men/women per queue with only 1-2 working at any point. The line I was in took a good 20 minutes and there were only 3 people in front of me. In general security wasn't busy. When we tried to go to our gate we were stopped by another security guard because we didn't have tags on our bags saying we went through security. We went back to the security counter and asked for tags. One found a tag for some random airline on the floor and eventually put it on my mothers bag.

Mumbai,Very disappointed. Stunning building - experience completely ruined by mosquitoes and dreadful queue management. On departure First Class and Business class passengers lost it with the ineffective Staff at passport control (quite a sight at 1am).

Road to the terminal is well maintained and elevated with 4 entrances for the security checks to get into the terminal.

Tons of shops though not completely open due to recent facility opening.

Mumbai,Avoid this airport if at all possible. The problem is that it took us over 2 hours to transfer from the international side to the domestic side which caused us to miss our domestic flight. Jet Airways did not offer help. We finally figured out that we had to pay them a penalty to get another flight 22 hours later. This is caused by the inefficiency of the security people and their cumbersome procedures. The new terminal will not solve this problem.

Mumbai,My wife and I had the pleasure of boarding our flight at the new Terminal 2 at 1 am on Feb 13. Having arrived at and departed from Mumbai's international and domestic terminals several times over the past two decades I can honestly say that the new Terminal 2 represents a quantum leap in (for the most part) vastly improving the passenger experience. This includes the new elevated access ramp to the terminal from the Western Express Highway. The terminal building itself is an architectural wonder. There is lots of glass all owing expansive views of the airport. Spacious seating / waiting areas with clear flight boarding announcement. Slightly secluded seating areas with relaxing arm chairs and modular sofa type seating configurations. Numerous bistros and coffee shops in a shopping mall type of a layout. Interesting and original retail outlets. As this was the first day of operations several stores were not yet open or had goods displayed but were not available for shopping. Nevertheless the store managers invited us to have a look around. Likewise the duty free shops were still stocking up with only a few items for sale. Washrooms were very clean and well distributed throughout the terminal. One aspect that could be improved is the still cumbersome process of passport and visa checks for outbound passengers which seems to be largely bureaucratic and unnecessary. There was a long snaking line for this checkpoint before proceeding to the airside retail food and gate area which was tiresome and resulted in us feeling a bit too exhausted to fully explore the various stores and eateries.

Mumbai,We transferred from an internal flight to international - what a joke. We had 1 hour 15 minutes to boarding and 2 hours to flight departure and only just made the flight. Indeed our flight was delayed due to the need to wait for passengers still in security. The transfer bus drove out of the airport and in to the traffic jam of cars entering the airport (1 hour). Security was ridiculous and could easily have taken the two hours alone. Fortunately a group of us managed to persuade a very unhelpful guard to open a 'quicker queue' barrier (45 minutes) plus time to find boarding gate meaning we arrived at the plane at the departure time. Many of our companion transferees missed their flights. There were no members of staff able or accessible to assist.

Mumbai,When you fly out you are first greeted by millions of people come to see off their dear ones and spilling out on the streets. You can be run over by the luggage carts (thankfully free). Once in you realize how small the airport is. Go to the check-in counters and you'll see long queues. You are also welcomed by a mosquitoes and a funny musty smell. There are people who are employees of the airport just standing by and chatting amongst themselves watching. Post check-in you wait in a bad queue for immigration. They stamp your passport you then go through security again rudeness is everywhere. It is cumbersome. You are then pushed over down an escalator into Dutyfree and expensive food courts. Lack of seating. The free wifi is a joke since you need to fill a 4 page form on your phone. Gave up. When you fly into Mumbai the story doesn't change much. Doors open the stench and mosquitoes welcome you. You then walk on folded fake-grass carpets. Trying to push your wheeled carry-on bags wondering why they aren't moving. You see these men and women standing by and talking amongst themselves. If you're a returning Indian they will approach you under the pretext of helping you with your luggage. But don't be surprised by the hospitality they will ask you for money. Then you manage to reach the immigration lines. The line goes round and round and round. The immigration officials are a far cry from the ones you see in the US Canada or any developed country. They don't know what they are doing. They look at the passport and never look up. They talk amongst themselves asking what is to be done. You are generally hauled like cattle. Post immigration is hot and you will sweat. You are asked to go and collect your bags by a rude lady.

Mumbai,Recently had to transit via Mumbai airport and was amazed at how bad the airport and the staff is. First thing you notice while landing is that it is surrounded by slums. The airport does not appear very secure. Secondly as soon as you get out of the airplane you're greeted with a foul stench. You walk to the immigration counter - the guy doesn't even look at you or greet you. Is this how people are welcome to India? Next you proceed to claim your baggage and after clearing the customs head for the bus to take you to domestic terminal. You walk thru a dingy passage to the bus. The bus leaves every 30 mins. Its a good 20 mins ride. Once you arrive at the domestic terminal you cannot go past the security check point until it is within about 2 hrs of flight departure time. You have to wait in the ticketing/check-in counter area with limited seating till then. I met a guy who had a 12 hr layover and was stuck there. The security is a joke. The guy monitoring the x-ray machine was chatting away with his accomplice and not even looking at the computer monitor. The toilets are marginal. The domestic area is cramped.

Mumbai,Have used Mumbai airport many times as a solo traveller mostly had no problems or complaints. Recently I had to travel with my mother-in-law who is in a wheelchair. The airport does not have wheelchair facilities when you enter the airport you have to get in first through all the checks inform the counter and then bring somebody outside with the wheelchair. All this while my MIL had to wait without assistance. We were asked to wait in line even though she was in a wheelchair. Thirdly I was charged for the wheelchair facility! I was informed that the aircraft would land remotely and we would have to climb stairs to which I said my mother in law could not climb stairs! Told we needed an ambu-lift which at other airports I have been given access to. Here in Mumbai I was informed I will be charged for this.

Mumbai,I regularly travel via BOM. The domestic terminal is pleasant easy to use and convenient. Usually no queues except during rush hour. The international terminal has improved quite a lot on the inside with lots of shopping and eating facilities. However access has not. There was an insanely long queue just to get inside the terminal. I guess what people don't know is that you can use any of the doors. Most people queued at the entrance next to their airline apparently for hours just to get by security who checks every passport and boarding pass at snail's pace.

Mumbai,Transited through BOM while flying BLR-DXB. Onward to DXB was quite ok since it was an afternoon flight. Efficient transfer from domestic to international terminal in an AC coach. Immigration and security each took less than 10 minutes and lots of empty chairs at the gates. Some limited (but nice) food options at the gate. Returning from DXB was a totally different experience. We landed at 0220 and the onward domestic flight to BLR was at 0635. Immigration was quick (less than 5 minutes). Baggage took almost 25 minutes to arrive. We had to get our baggage screened for Customs and this required us to heave our bags onto the luggage screening belt. There was one more screening of baggage before we dropped them off and a security check before boarding the inter-terminal transfer coach. Security staff were rude and unconcerned. Once at the domestic terminal there was one more security check.

Mumbai,As mentioned by some of the reviewers here this is definitely the worst international airport that I have entered. Firstly the traffic chaos in the night when most international flights take off is just unbearable. Then you queue outside the airport for up to an hour as it inches forward before you encounter a policeman who checks your travel documents and passport. You finally enter the airport and queue for your check in. As we were flying business class check in was smooth. After that you are ushered to the immigration check in. It is chaotic. Officials are rude offensive and do not communicate in English. After you have eventually reached the immigration counter you are greeted by an individual who communicates with you via hand signals only. Following that you join yet another queue for security check in. Honestly it took me 3 hours from check in at the counter and depositing the hold luggage to security check. We had to run to the gate as the flight was ready to take off in 5 minutes. Our experience was very similar to other international passengers from a vast array of countries.

Mumbai,This airport is chaos. On arrival waited ages in immigration only to be met with stroppy staff. Took an hour to pass through immigration and collect bags. On departure the departure area is mental. You will not be allowed to enter the terminal if you arrive 3 hours before your flight. The police turn people away unless you slip them some cash. Beware the so called 'porters' who offer to get you to the front of the queues for a price. They are quite aggressive and one wanted 700 Rupees from me - no chance. Some retail outlets at the departure area mainly food and beverage (no alcohol) but they are very expensive. Once you finally get into departures to check in expect more queues and then when you go to immigration more chaos and queuing awaits. Immigration officers are the most sour faced ones I have encountered. Then the next hurdle - security and again the queues build up. Took nearly 3 hours from gaining entry to check-in going through check in through immigration and security before I reached my gate. Leave yourself plenty of time!

Mumbai,This was my first trip through Mumbai International (have used domestic several times with no problems) and it was painful chaotic and disorganized. I could not get my e-ticket to print and you will not be let in without a ticket or itinerary which I knew but hoped my business class status or email confirmation would be of some assistance. No such luck. I managed to beg my way into the passengers lounge to wait until 3 hours before my departure at which point security had an airline employee physically take my passport from me for 10 minutes to confirm my status. Upon entering I noticed the terminal was littered with kiosks for printing out tickets and online check-in - I don't know who uses them. Business class immigration did indeed take longer than economy. There was no separation of ticket class for baggage screening and only after standing in a completely unlabeled line for 10 minutes did an employee come by to point out that women were screened at the far side of the area in a spot completely unviewable from the main line entry. There were 7 scanners for men to the 1 available to women. The total process took 2 hours and was one of the most disorganized events I've seen. Large numbers of passengers were escorted to the front of lines for flights leaving in ten minutes.

Mumbai,Possibly the worst international airport in the world. The plane parked at one end of the terminal so we had to walk right to the other end to the immigration desk. A long painful walk made worse by no air- conditioning. Immigration fully manned so the wait was about 5 minutes. I then had to wait for my J class luggage. It took 45 minutes long after everyone else's luggage. The belt is tiny for a 747 luggage volume and there are too many obstructions close by - trolleys plants walls pillars signs. Then another long queue for security screening of suitcases and hand luggage. And finally another long walk to the greeting area. Apparently they have been building the new international airport for 5 years! Long overdue. Departures was shambolic. Arrived 2 hours before the flight and the queue was a good 300 metres - Thai flyers were only allowed to go through one gate (again for a 747 volume this is mindless bureaucratic stupidity). The touts were harassing everyone and anyone for tips. Get in and the actual check-in queues for business and economy were quite good and fairly quick. Then over to immigration. Business class had only 2 desks and it took 30 minutes to get to the front. This was painful in the stifling heat. The economy class line was moving faster than business.

Mumbai,What a shambles I view myself as a seasoned traveller and my connection through Mumbai domestic- international has to be the worse experience ever. My domestic flight was late arriving (45 mins) and although I was told to identify myself to the ground staff which I did but to what avail I'm unsure. I had to transfer by bus from the domestic terminal to the international one which comprises of: 1) wait in a line for a transfer bus and have my bags screened (apparently I’d been fast-tracked and hadn't had to wait on a ticket to join this line). 2) Sat on the bus for 15 mins while it loaded the bus finally left the domestic terminal at midnight next flight left at 1am. 3) The bus then acts as a tour bus for the airport it seems having to wait for planes to pull out of gates etc. 4) Once the bus arrived at the international terminal we had to wait I had to go back through security and go to the check-in desk again. At this point it was 12.20 the check-in guy told me that I was too late for the flight but a bit of persuasion and pointing out that it was due to the issues at the airport/late flight meant that they fast tracked me through the system process was also quite smooth from that point but i realize that was due to the fact that I had no luggage to check and flying business class. 5) Once through security (jumped the queue due to kindness of other passengers) raced through the terminal to departure gate. 6)It was then another bus to board the airplane (past where I just gone 30 mins before).

Mumbai,If you are lucky enough to be travelling in Business/First there is a separate immigration desk so you do not join the longer lines.

Mumbai,I'm a regular flyer through Mumbai airport though I normally arrive here and fly out of Bangalore back to the UK. I do this trip 10 times a year. The Indian system is a pain but it's very clever and simple. No stamp on your hand baggage and you cannot board the aircraft until it's been screened. Also only allowing people with their names on the manifest to enter the building whilst not completely foolproof adds to the layer of security. I have never found the staff rude or unhelpful anywhere in India. They are respectful probably because I am respectful to them. I live in Cyprus and it depends who's on duty as to how thoroughly they check. I forgot to put a nail-file in my checked baggage and it passed through Cyprus security unnoticed.

Mumbai,I went through Mumbai airport on a recent visit to India travelling with Jet Airways. I was aware of Mumbai's fearful reputation and was apprehensive about have to transit through it. However I was pleasantly surprised. No queue at immigration bags turned up fairly quickly and customs wasn't a problem though bags are screened incredibly often. Our transfer to the domestic terminal was quite smooth as well though the bus does go on a tour of the airport facility. The domestic terminal was remarkably clean and facilities were fine given that it was early hours of the morning. We had to change some sterling to INRs but that too went okay and we had no trouble with the exchange desk. Our only problem came at security in the domestic terminal where my husband's bag was retained. He was carrying our personal camera equipment and his diabetic medication. Our cameras were removed and the bag re-scanned. The security officer came over with the bag asked if he used insulin and immediately stamped the bag as cleared. We had to wait around 2 hours for our connection to Bangalore but again this wasn't a major issue. However despite this it would be my last choice of airport to go through - its not entirely up to international standards yet but hopefully it will get there.,5.0,0,Unknown,Unknown,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,Unknown,went mumbai airport recent visit india travelling jet airways aware mumbais fearful reputation apprehensive transit however pleasantly surprised queue immigration bags turned fairly quickly customs wasnt problem though bags screened incredibly often transfer domestic terminal quite smooth well though bus go tour airport facility domestic terminal remarkably clean facilities fine given early hours morning change sterling inrs went okay trouble exchange desk problem came security domestic terminal husbands bag retained carrying personal camera equipment diabetic medication cameras removed bag rescanned security officer came bag asked used insulin immediately stamped bag cleared wait around hours connection bangalore wasnt major issue however despite would last choice airport go entirely international standards yet hopefully get,0.9184,Positive,Indian

You will spend around 3 to 4 hours in different lines before you are able to arrive at the boarding area again to find that there is no space to sit until boarding announcement is made.

Mumbai,Recently visited Mumbai and was pleasantly surprised by my experience for arrival and departure with an infant. Was visiting with my 6 month old daughter so was a bit apprehensive about it. Arrival was a breeze without any queue. Had to wait for an hour for the bags hopefully they improve the baggage handling facilities and remove the hanger ons nearby the baggage claim looking to make money. n departure it was again a pleasant experience with the official letting us the First class line for Immigration because of the infant. Also for infants there is a totally separate counter for security check which allows one to have enough time to security check all the additional items ie strollers ormula and water bottles without being hurried by other people. Had plenty of empty seats in the airport to wait for the flight. Was leaving from Continental flight which leave for Gate 12 which have an additional security check.

Mumbai,"One of the worst airports in the world. You can't enter the airport terminal before the check- in counter for your flight opens 3 hrs ahead. Therefore you have the choice of standing outside as the few seats are reserved for the ""security staff"". You are not allowed to sit there! Nevertheless you have the option of entering a ""visitor lounge"" (which is a part of the terminal that is separated from the terminal by a glass window) for a fee of 60 INR. The are only seats in this lounge. Maybe the airport director needs a new car or house... Once you're inside the airport you have to go through a lengthy check-in procedure. Very few self check in machines. The counters are well staffed but as checking in 3 pax takes +/- 7 minutes you can imagine the mess after that 15 people joined the queue. Once you pass this you have to go through immigration (quite swift) and the pass the lengthy security check.

Mumbai,BOM is a disaster even in it's newer state. First problem is the lack of signs and communication for international transit passengers. You follow one sign that basically takes right outside the building where you stand and swelter in the Mumbai heat waiting to be allowed in. Secondly once you're in there are no seats in which to rest while waiting for your flight check-in desk to open. Then they have this great rule that even if you have a multiple entry visa and are travelling on the same itinerary you need to go to a special immigration office and wait while they take the longest photocopies in the world of your documentation. Then after they separate men and women in security; they put these bizzare tags on your hand luggage and stamp them. They are secured with but a string which makes they easily lost. And god help you if you are connecting to the domestic terminal in short order. The process has to be the most inefficient and uncoordinated thing I have ever seen in an international airport. Also be prepared. You will go through no less than 4-5 security screenings; no matter what you're doing in the airport. And they don't move at any other speed than slow in BOM. In terms of cleanliness I was surprised by how clean the restrooms were in the international terminal however the domestic terminal is revolting.

Mumbai,Having travelled alone and also with kids you get preferential treatment when you travel with infants. The airport staff lets you bypass any queue and you get access direct to the boarding lounge. Travelling alone the only hitch is when you are passing security they can be quite rude in speaking and checking your baggage. The boarding hall is a big improvement. Costs of things are quite expensive but decor in departure is quite nice. I'd rate departure poor. Arrival a disaster. As soon as you get off the plane you smell mouldy carpets/ walls . They have less immigration counters and really long lines: why cant they open more immigration counters for quick passenger flow: Just before getting out of the airport they have a taxi stand that blocks the exit. Hence passenger commotion as people with trolleys waiting in the taxi queue block the people want to exit the airport. They should move this taxi booth to another location and also have more options for pre paid taxi booths.

Mumbai,Flew into the domestic terminal and connected with an international flight. Airport was impressive and more than I expected from the reputation! The flight was scheduled for 4am which reflects the lack of queues but airport was clean retail areas were spacious and there were fantastic recliner seating areas at each boarding gate and coffee shops nearby. The duty free area seemed similar to that at Dubai Terminal 3 and it seems the airport are trying to improve their image. I also liked that there were highly visible emergency defibrillators located at regular intervals throughout the airport. Other airports would do well to follow suit. Staff were lively polite and helpful. Have to mention one of the police/security guys at the front of the airport who went out in the monsoon rain to fetch our dimwit of a cab driver who had got lost (don't ask me how a taxi driver gets lost at an airport complex...). Really did appreciate that personal touch and not something that I would expect in Europe/US regions.

Mumbai,The airport has transformed in recent years - it was quite clean less noisy and chaotic and a decent airport experience. Quite a change from few years back. The only gripe was the traffic/chaos outside the airport. Due to security reasons the traffic police just allows one row of vehicles to the airport departures due to which there was a huge traffic jam and this combined with the sea of people saying good byes to their loved ones means a huge chaos. But once inside the airport it all changes. I did not have to queue anywhere (checkin immigration security) for more than 10 minutes.

Mumbai,"Was at Chhatrapati Shivaji recently and shocked by the state of the place. I understand they are building a new terminal so this can't come quick enough. I was in transit with Jet Airways and found the experience painful. The extensive queues are extremely long and the security checking inconsistent. We found that duty free was being confiscated at random. Some people getting through with liquids galore. In some cases they were even confiscating dry products. What then shocked me is the fact that the airport operates like some seedy back alley part of Mumbai. Being a smoker I asked official staff where to smoke and was first pointed to the toilet. Confused I then asked another member of staff and was further escorted to a janitor's closet where the janitor was waiting and said: ""five dollar you smoke here"" - in a storage cupboard! Not convinced I then asked somebody else and was pointed to the restaurant likewise where they are charging passengers to smoke illicitly in a storage room. I refused of course. BOM is a non smoking airport no matter what they tell you or where they lead you. At one point paying for duty free took 15 minutes no reason just lots of paper work fiddling around with my documents and so on. It was all very suspicious. Finally we ordered some KFC at the counter having contracted Delhi Belly on the outward journey - thinking that deep fried chicken would be the most sanitary option. While we waited for food an 8 inch long rat jumped onto the counter chased by a member of staff - ran along the counter over the cash desk and up a wall. This was much to the amusement of the staff who gladly went on serving food without even washing their hands.

Mumbai,As a frequent user of the Mumbai Airport I agree with the general comments here. As with things in India it just needs someone with a brain to sort it out. If you are in the BA club lounge stay there. The outside bars/food are overpriced. If you are a smoker go to the Celebrations bar but they will make you buy a drink first (beer £7!). How is this bar allowed given that it is a no smoking airport! Never let your credit card out of your sight as a few passengers were complaining about misuse on their prior visits. The duty-free shops are bland with US$ prices: no Indian whisky. Presumably Indian whisky is considered too downmarket!

Even though we were just transit passengers who in other airports would have been pre-cleared hundreds of us waited for over two hours to go through security again.

Mumbai,The most annoying airport I have yet to find to transit through and catch a connecting flight. Normally two hours would easily be enough time to disembark one plane and be at the gate ready to board the next. Not at Mumbai. First you are made to wait with other passengers who have just disembarked your plane in a loud crowded immigration hall. You are then led upstairs and along corridors to transit security. Yes you have to go through security again. So they need to check your ticket. Then men and women are divided into separate queues from where couples can't even see each other. In these queues people are stressed and often looking to push ahead of you. As well as this if you are in the male queue you cannot see the end of the queue as it goes around a corner so you have no idea how long it will all take. The security queue took well over an hour to pass through on both times I had the misfortune to enter it and both times I only just made my connecting flight. Furthermore the security officials make it their job to frisk everyone whether you set the scanner off or not and go through a tedious process of stamping a label you have to attach to your bag and your boarding pass to show you have been through security. After showing your boarding pass and passport to the airline officials at the gate you can then be stopped by further security personnel on the way to the plane who wish to check your documents again just to see if you have been through security or not.

Design and Ambiance: The terminal boasts a stunning architectural design that blends modern aesthetics with traditional Indian elements. The spacious layout is filled with natural light, thanks to large glass facades. The use of local materials in the design adds a unique touch, making the environment both inviting and reflective of Karnataka’s heritage. Facilities: One of the standout features of the new terminal is its state-of-the-art facilities. From efficient check-in counters to well-organized security checks, the entire process felt streamlined and user-friendly. The wide range of shopping and dining options is impressive, offering everything from local delicacies to international brands. I particularly enjoyed the curated selection of souvenirs that showcase local artisans. Technology: The incorporation of technology is commendable. Free Wi-Fi, charging stations, and self-check-in kiosks make the travel experience more convenient. The digital displays for flight information are clear and easy to navigate, which is essential in such a busy hub. Sustainability: What truly sets this airport apart is its commitment to sustainability. The use of rainwater harvesting systems and solar energy reflects a forward-thinking approach to airport management, which is vital in today’s context of climate change. Accessibility: The airport is well-connected, with ample transportation options including taxis, buses, and ride-sharing services. The ease of access from the city makes it a practical choice for travelers. Overall Impression: In summary, the new terminal at Kempegowda International Airport is a remarkable blend of modernity, functionality, and cultural resonance. It elevates the travel experience and sets a high standard for airports in India.

Bangalore,"✅ Trip Verified | The new international terminal is a nice building but the traveller experience was awful. I should add it was not just our experience but the same as others caught in the same ridiculous situation. We had arrived via a domestic flight (Indigo) which was seven hours before our international departure. We were bused to the new international terminal and told we could not enter the building because our flight didn't open for another four hours. The expectation was that we would wait on the kerb where there are no amenities, for four hours. Bureaucratic nonsense and bad experience one. After pressing the security staff we were eventually allowed into the ticketing foyer. But we were not allowed into the terminal proper and had to wait there for four hours where there are no amenities for transiting passengers. We had boarding passes for our international connections but were not allowed into the airport proper where we could make use of cafes and the lounges and bathrooms. Bad experience two - waiting in a hall not designed for waiting passengers. And not just ourselves but numerous other transit passengers as well. A nice building let down but business processes that make no sense. Worse, when I attempted to email management (feedback emails advertised everywhere) they blamed the airlines for not aligning their flights! That was really poor form. If you have a poor business process (and you do) don't blame someone else for it - solve it. The management team here need to look at every other half decent terminal around the world to see how it's done. Singapore. Bangkok. KL.

Bangalore,"❎ Not Verified | Generally a good airport, I have never had any issues from checking in to departure during my multiple visits. You need to have a printout of your itinerary to make it into the building (Indian citizens, like me, are used to this). You can pull up the itinerary on your smart phone too. Lounge area is good, so are the restaurants. Amenities are satisfactory, washrooms are reasonably clean. Immigration is fairly simple (again, from an Indian citizen's perspective). It helps to know Kannada to get by as most staff speak in Kannada. Security personnel are from the Central Industrial Security Force, so they only speak in Hindi. However, speaking in English can also get you through all the processes too. The biggest disappointment is the wifi (very sad because Bengaluru is touted as the IT city). Wifi can only be availed via a process where the system sends a one-time passcode (OTP) for authentication. This is a big issue if you have a phone with an international SIM card in it. The 'regular' process of logging in does not work, and this is revealed deep in the FAQs. You actually need to go to the airport helpdesk in the waiting lounge to get assistance to get the connection. I got the complimentary 45 minutes of free wifi and left the helpdesk with instructions to avail the paid wifi after my 45 minutes expired. However, I was unable to buy wifi, again due to the OTP issue and there is no helpdesk in the departure gates area. Wifi is something you just take for granted in major international airports, so Bengaluru really needs to get its act together and find a way around the OTP nightmare! So on my next visit, I will seek assistance at the helpdesk to just buy wifi, skipping the 45 minutes of free time. Cabs are available right outside the building, but they are the expensive ones (KSTDC). If you have an Uber or Ola app in your phone, and roaming data (assuming you have an international SIM like me), pickup stations for both these rideshares are a short walk away. If you have used Uber in the US, I am told that the same app will work in Bengaluru. If you reside outside India, make sure to have an active international roaming plan with a decent amount of data, just about everything in India requires OTP authentication.

Bangalore,Bad. My family and I are frequent flyers to the Middle East. And among the 3 Indian Airports used by us (Mangalore Bangalore Mumbai) Bangalore seems to be the worst in terms of service. I have no complaints regarding the infrastructure however the staff I've dealt with in Bangalore are the just too uncivil. My mother has had bad experiences with the immigration staff a couple of times. Extremely rude and arrogant. I have had my share of experiences.

Bangalore,The airport is located in what can best be described as a tin shed. There was no skybridge and no bus - they actually made us walk for a hundred yards in the dark to reach the 'terminal'. I don't have to mention that everyone from the ground staff to the guys unloading the luggage were rudely asking us for money all the way through. The arrival hall was a disaster. We were herded through like cattle past passport control and customs - the fact that they took their time shaking down each and every of the foreign passengers for money didn't make the queue go any faster. There was no AC in the hall and no ventilation either. Speaking of queues - the Indian passengers didn't seem to know what that was and crowded the counters in spite of protests from the foreigners in line. Baggage pickup was in a dinghy hall where our stuff was just dumped in the middle in a huge heap leaving us to pull it out by ourselves. There was no security and no order at all. From the outside the airport tried its best to exude a modern facade with a sweeping roof apparently built at great expense by an American company and it did succeed even though the roof was badly maintained and falling apart in places. But it did not make up for the fact that this was one place you really do not want to fly through.

Bangalore,I recently flew in to Bangalore from Sydney through Cathay Pacific / Dragonair. Then after a few days I used this airport for the Bangalore - Chennai domestic leg via Jet airways as well. The airport has got good facilities and offers a reasonable first impression of the city. All the immigration counters were open and it helped the passengers to move out of the section quickly. However the space between the steps / escalator leading to the immigration hall and the counters is not large enough which makes the queuing a bit difficult than it should otherwise. The on-arrival visa counter had good signage with helpful attendant being present. The customs was a breeze and the carousel worked adequately well. Unlike most Indian airports getting out of the airport is a pleasant experience since it has got ample space and the cab drivers and other onlookers are kept at an arms length.,7.0,1,Unknown,Unknown,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,Unknown,recently flew bangalore sydney cathay pacific dragonair days used airport bangalore chennai domestic leg via jet airways well airport got good facilities offers reasonable first impression city immigration counters open helped passengers move section quickly however space steps escalator leading immigration hall counters large enough makes queuing bit difficult otherwise onarrival visa counter good signage helpful attendant present customs breeze carousel worked adequately well unlike indian airports getting airport pleasant experience since got ample space cab drivers onlookers kept arms length,0.926,Positive,Indian

Bangalore,This airport probably has the worst immigration process among all the airports I have used in India and abroad. The officers are arrogant and seem to enjoy exercising their powers on all Indian passengers They just don't seem to care about the fact that the queue is 50 to 60 deep at each counter at 2am. They don't stop at examining whether you have a visa for the country you are proceeding to. I was asked why I was flying out of Bangalore when I have taken most of my previous flights out of Chennai. Every passenger was being asked for the return ticket which is something that is never asked for in Chennai. I always buy one way tickets because my programme is variable and my departure airport is never fixed in advance. On a previous occasion when I was flying BLR-SIN on a one way ticket I was denied immigration clearance for a long time till I told them that I could open my computer and book a return ticket on the spot. I told them that nowadays even the entry airports at foreign countries don't ask for a return ticket. My explanations seemed to infuriate the officer who started raising his voice and it was only the timely intervention of a senior officer who had come to investigate why the queue was not moving that I finally got through immigration.

Bangalore,Used the BLR airport 4 times in the last 3 weeks - arriving on Lufthansa flying to Delhi and back on Indigo and flying to Mumbai on Kingfisher. Overall experience has been as good or better than when I last used the airport in mid 2009. The relatively compact size of the terminal sometimes makes it appear inadequate but didn't actually encounter a situation of overcrowding - either in the waiting area or elsewhere. Don't think the use of buses for embarking/disembarking is always directly related to any lack of availability of overbridges. Low cost airlines avoid airbridges to save on their usage charges. Airbridges were used on Lufthansa and Kingfisher but not Indigo. Immigration baggage and customs on arrival were very quick. Security lines were on the longer side but not a cause for concern if you arrive about 75 minutes prior to domestic departure. In general baggage handling appears to be pretty efficient. Porter service continues to be helpful and useful. There seem to be more food options within the terminal and outside in the waiting/parking area.

Baggage service was remarkably quick - bags had started appearing on the belts less than two minutes after we walked into the terminal. Much better than the airport in HYD which was built by the same company. On departure there's not much to write home about outside of security. All I could find was a Cafe Coffee Day which served their products at double the price you can get elsewhere in the city. Also beware that you now have to pay a departure fee of Rs. 285 per person which isn't automatically included in the cost of most tickets. Security is efficient and there's a large number of shops up at gate level. The inline security system is also nice as you don't have to put your checked bags through an X-ray machine before going to the counter.

Bangalore,It is a vast improvement on its pathetic predecessor. Low cost airlines appear to avoid using the airbridges so arrival into the terminal building was on a bus. Arrival was pleasant: toilets clean and adequate luggage was out in a jiffy and getting ground transportation was hassle free. Departure also pleasant though I suspect this was at least partially because of the 10.25 am departure when few other intl flights leave. The check in area is large and has an international look and feel. Not having to screen bags through Xray before check-in (normal practice in most Indian airports) is a big help. Porter service is efficient professional and reasonable priced (Rs 70 per cart - which is less than $2). Immigration and security check were a breeze because our flight was the only intl one around that time. Immigration staff well turned out and looked more professional.

Bangalore,"I have used the new Bangalore airport half a dozen times for domestic commutes. No international travel so far. Enjoyed every single visit. Entry to the airport is via a six-lane road which branches off from the Bangalore-Hyderabad highway. Smooth drive all the way to the curb-side drop off. No congestion at all. Check-in was a breeze with plenty of space and no crowding. The very high ceiling gives a feeling of spaciousness and feels really good. Security check was also very quick with no hold-ups.

Bangalore,"Arrived at 1.30am. First impression is that of a modern airport. Move on and you will realize that they have simply moved the inefficient overcrowded immigration area from the old airport to the new one; immigration officers in rag-tag outfits no uniforms and some with woolly hats pulled down over their heads. Baggage took more than an hour to make it onto the belt - you don't need a new airport for that. We had a four-hour wait for a domestic connection and were refused entry to the departure hall when we showed our e-tickets on our Blackberry screens. Instead we had to go outside get the domestic airline to print out tickets and then re-enter (welcome to Bangalore India's IT capital!). Only coffee outlets open - even the ""Time Out Bar"" in the domestic departure area is not a bar but a mere coffee counter.

Bangalore,Used BIAL 4 times within 2 weeks for 3 domestic flights and one international departure. I found the whole experience very good. Everyone cribs about the distance of the new airport to the city centre. Over time people will forget about the old airport and will factor the distance to the new airport into their overall journey. Once the Namma metro is complete the journey will be even more convenient. At the moment one has to travel either by taxi or take the city bus. The city bus transfer is clearly signposted and very efficient with around 8 different routes into the city departing every 20mins or so. My journey to/from Indiranagar took just over an hour on all occasions. The airport itself is finally the first international standard airport in India (I haven't been to the new airport in HYD) with decent shops the Kingfisher bar cafes lots of immigration and security queus and clean tiolets! My personal overall experience was very positive. The only issue I could see was with the size of the international departure lounge. My BA 747 was full and the 350 passengers took up around half of the available seats in the international departure area. I imagine that at around midnight when AF LH TG SQ and KL all operate 777s or A330s that the departure area will be bursting at its seams.

Bangalore,I arrived by Lufthansa at 1205 at BIAL. Baggage took over one hour to come. There were seven baggage belts but each belt area had inadequate space for passengers who were waiting. The air conditioner was switched off. It was hot and humid. To reach one's car with driver one had to walk a long distance since private cars were not allowed near the terminal. Signposting outside the terminal was abysmal with no signs indicating exit and direction. The airport charges Rs 70/ for a coolie with trolley. And of course one pays a tip doubling the cost compared to the old airport. There were many immigration desks and it was quick.

Bangalore,"Used the new Bangalore Airport to depart on an international flight to Paris. This was about 5 days since the new airport was opened for operations. First - getting there: we drove from the west end of town at approximately 10pm (well past the ""rush"" hour) so the experience was pleasant. A minor bottleneck (construction) was the only notable thing which I assume will be resolved pretty soon. Second - at the airport - signage for parking drop-off etc was poor and our driver had to make a few circuits to finally get us to the proper drop-off point. Plenty of people in uniform trying to give directions but better signage would have helped. Terminal - nice new feel to it usual check- in lines. You go up a level for passport control and then security. Both went smoothly with minimal waits. You could almost say the airport appeared overstaffed but this was probably due to complaints of teething troubles in the newspapers in the first few days of operation.

However it may not be correct to directly relate the conditions at airport to the name ""silicon valley of India"".

Bangalore,I have been travelling through Bangalore airport regularly over the last few years and it never ceases to amaze me how strange and annoying the place is. The facilities are the worst of any airport I have ever been to and checking in is like being in a zoo. Even though some of the airlines try to board their passengers by row this is just not happening. As soon as the first boarding announcement is made expect a stampede. It is almost like they think the plane will leave without them if they don't get on first. The (unofficial) smoking area is in the toilet! Even though carrying matches or lighters onto the plane is not allowed the entrepreneurial toilet attendant will happily light your cigarette for you and steer you to one of the two cubicles. A few rupee tip is expected for this service. Bring your own toilet paper if you need to use the toilet as the airport supply is haphazard to say the least. Make sure you eat before you get there as the single coffee shop is next to hopeless and very much more expensive for the rubbish served than anywhere else in town. The departure area is awful. The seats are filthy and the flight information screen of virtually no use as it is normally several hours behind or showing information on arrivals or domestic departures which go from a different hall. The current airport is however very conveniently located with most places no more than twenty to thirty minutes away. The new airport under construction is going to mean trips of up to two hours for lots of travellers as Bangalores traffic is a disaster all of the time and worse if it rains. After immigration on arrival delays getting to baggage reclaim are caused by your carry on bag being x-rayed and you going through a metal detector. Quite why this is needed when you have just finished your flight is beyond me. Baggage reclaim is slow. Watch out for the farm tractor pulling trolleys of suitcases. When you arrive and walk outside expect to be approached by a multitude of hopefuls wanting to carry your luggage or be your taxi. You can also expect to be quoted outrageous figures for your transport. You know you are being ripped off when you see a cloth placed over the meter. Very few places justify a fee of above 200 Rupees for a taxi or 100 for an autorickshaw. If you are being picked up you will probably have to brave the crowd outside to find them as there is a fee to come inside to meet you and most drivers just won't pay it.,1.0,0,Unknown,Unknown,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Unknown,travelling bangalore airport regularly last years never ceases amaze strange annoying place facilities worst airport ever checking like zoo even though airlines try board passengers row happening soon first boarding announcement made expect stampede almost like think plane leave without dont get first unofficial smoking area toilet even though carrying matches lighters onto plane allowed entrepreneurial toilet attendant happily light cigarette steer one two cubicles rupee tip expected service bring toilet paper need use toilet airport supply haphazard say least make sure eat get single coffee shop next hopeless much expensive rubbish served anywhere else town departure area awful seats filthy flight information screen virtually use normally several hours behind showing information arrivals domestic departures go different hall current airport however conveniently located places twenty thirty minutes away new airport construction going mean trips two hours lots travellers bangalores traffic disaster time worse rains immigration arrival delays getting baggage reclaim caused carry bag xrayed going metal detector quite needed finished flight beyond baggage reclaim slow watch farm tractor pulling trolleys suitcases arrive walk outside expect approached multitude hopefuls wanting carry luggage taxi also expect quoted outrageous figures transport know ripped see cloth placed meter places justify fee rupees taxi autorickshaw picked probably brave crowd outside find fee come inside meet drivers wont pay,-0.932,Negative,Indian

Bangalore,Agree with other comments that while Bangalore airport is not Changi it's not the abyss described by many. Having experience explosive growth in the region with a new airport on the way it's amazing that this little military airport holds up under the pressure. There's a special charm about this airport - and while taxed by the increasing number of passengers coming through this tiny facility I think that the airport administration has done a pretty good job. Arriving from Paris at 1 AM I was through customs picked up luggage (after having to wake up the porters who were sleeping on the belt!) and into my car in 30 minutes. On the way out on a mid-afternoon flight from BLR to BOM I was checked in and through security in 10 minutes.

No porters trying to get money from you when you arrived (which was around midnight for the 01h55 LH departure). There was only one X-ray machine for hold baggage prior to check-in but no queue when we were there. Check-in itself was run by Lufthansa and superb able to check us through to the final destination. No wait for security and had our luggage tags stamped to show we had been checked. The departure lounge is tiny and the international terminal has only two gates but one is closed so flights board one at a time. Toilets were clean. No lounges of any sort but also no mosquitoes or flies to be seen.

Bangalore,Bangalore for a so-called IT-Capital has an appaling airport. There is basically nothing to do at the airport for the 2-3 hours you wait in order to board your flight. Security check is a pain as the uniformed staff simply insist on checking the same luggage over and over again (I had my laptop bag poked and prodded and checked 4 times over the course of 5 minutes). Also they seem to be paranoid about getting your luggage tags 'stamped'. I had to go through security again because I had not gotten my tags 'stamped' - what a joke. There is no first or business class lounge and the entire departure lounge was filled with pax waiting for the 4 flights to CDG FRA BKK and SIN. There is only one departure gate for international flights and as you can imagine it was a mess when it was time to board. There is no priority boarding for first and business or Star Alliance pax (even though the lady was trying in vain to make the announcement that boarding at that time was only for first and Star Alliance gold card pax). The building is not airconditioned instead there are huge fans blasting air right on top of the people's heads. There is a Coffe Day coffee shop but the prices are crazy (US$5 for a cup of coffee!) and they have a few cookies and bottled water. I suggest not buying anything there.

Actually they also have airport threecycle taxi but when I tried it they conned me by asking double the meter because it was before 6am.

Bangalore,Bangalore Airport is as other Indian airports not a place to relax. At night they have a few international flights eg. to BKK FRA and CDG but only one departure gate which means that the small waiting hall is completely overcrowded. Business Class lounges are not existing. You have to pass the usual uncountable check points for everything to keep the huge amount of uniformed staff working. The newest idea of the airport authorities seems to be that they strictly allow now only one piece of hand baggage. So even when Air France accepted my two pieces (Laptop bag and small briefcase) I faced a unpleasant discussion at the security check point together with nearly all other passengers who had two pieces. (Even cameras and hand bags were counted as one piece).

Bangalore,You will probably be greeted by several porters who will get the luggage out of your car and take in up to check-in for you. There is nothing to do at this airport. It is basically check-in security (which opens at 5am) and then you are in the departure lounge. There is a small duty free shop (with a reasonable selection of alcohol and cigarettes and prices in US$) and one or two souvenir shops in the departure lounge but that's just about it. There is also a (yellow) mobile charging box on the wall to the left of the actual gate. A small coffee shop (Coffee Day) serves coffee soft drinks and snacks. The coffee is very good - quite strong but very nice and great at 5.30 in the morning. There were additional outlets but they were not open when I was there. Snacks were not that great but there were sandwiches cookies and a variety of cakes. The boarding process was laborious. There was one guard who checks your boarding pass and that you have stamped hand baggage (you have to attach a luggage tag to your hand baggage and this gets stamped when you go through security/xray screening) receipts. You then go through secondary screening (random) and tertiary screening (also random) followed by boarding pass processing and finally you get on the plane!

Bangalore,One could be forgiven for not realising that one is at the airport of what is trumpeted as India’s IT capital. Checking in with any airline using Air India’s computer terminals at BLR passengers can forget about obtaining boarding passes to their final destination if their trip involves a transfer at an intermediate point – the system cannot handle anything but the leg departing from Bangalore. The immigration desks have no scanners for swiping machine-readable passports. However there is uniformed personnel in abundance – some of them doing nothing else but checking whether their counterpart a few yards away has placed a stamp in your documents. Where they are really needed these officers do nothing. Boarding a TG flight on 7th August the procedure was a disaster. Instead of providing the announced priority to families with children and those needing special assistance (and then allowing business class passengers on first) the uniformed guard at the gate was happily (yet again) checking for the numerous stamps on boarding passes of anyone who was rude enough to push their way through (and such people are in abundance in India let me tell you). On the infrastructure side matters have deteriorated even further. Last week I witnessed the collapse of a new structure designed to hide the aircon ducts in the domestic terminal burying the Kingfisher check in desk and one of their agents under the debris. At the international departures building buying a visitor’s ticket has become a farce as passengers and visitors are now separated at the front door and have to use separate escalators. And judging by the state of the seats in the international departures lounge I wonder whether the stray dogs that are omnipresent on the apron area are allowed to use the seats during quite periods – it is simply unimaginable that humans could soil cushions to that extent – and even more so that no one seems to realize they need cleaning.,4.0,0,Unknown,Unknown,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Unknown,one could forgiven realising one airport trumpeted indias capital checking airline using air indias computer terminals blr passengers forget obtaining boarding passes final destination trip involves transfer intermediate point system handle anything leg departing bangalore immigration desks scanners swiping machinereadable passports however uniformed personnel abundance nothing else checking whether counterpart yards away placed stamp documents really needed officers nothing boarding tg flight th august procedure disaster instead providing announced priority families children needing special assistance allowing business class passengers first uniformed guard gate happily yet checking numerous stamps boarding passes anyone rude enough push way people abundance india let tell infrastructure side matters deteriorated even last week witnessed collapse new structure designed hide aircon ducts domestic terminal burying kingfisher check desk one agents debris international departures building buying visitors ticket become farce passengers visitors separated front door use separate escalators judging state seats international departures lounge wonder whether stray dogs omnipresent apron area allowed use seats quite periods simply unimaginable humans could soil cushions extent even one seems realize need cleaning,-0.765,Negative,Indian

I put all my belongings to the tray & handed over my baby to my mother so that I fold the baby stroller Then all of a sudden other flyers started barging in. Pilots, all the VIP customers & in seconds it was like a fish market where no que system was followed. They started pushing me back and started to put their stuffs Meanwhile my baby had passed the security with my mother & was screaming as she couldn’t see me. I still hold the stroller begging the security guards to guide me - finally I had to raise my voice & a security guard comes and tell me to remove all the tires of the stroller as it won’t fit their machine .. my baby continues to scream cry but the staffs were deaf about it! I finally remove all the tires & rush in for security check. The lady there is so slow and rude - she wants to check me thoroughly so she was taking her sweet own time I cross the security & again there is no one there to help me put together the pram.

When I reached the HYD airport domestic security check I saw 2 police staff members talking in a very rude way (I was at the right most security check counter). I was asked (along with other people in the queue) to take out all the electronic items, belt, wallet, outside in a tray which I did fine. After that I saw that I needed to hold the tray in order to put it in the scanner so I did that with all of my hand injuries. While collecting the hand baggage I found that it was kept aside so I asked the security personnel very politely why it was kept aside, to which he replied very rudely that ""school khatam ho chuka hai, abhi tak samaan handel karna nahi aaya!!"" (meaning ""school is over but still you don't know how to keep your things properly!""). So I asked him to check in the bag to see if I have missed something because I had taken out all the things they have asked for. Then he opened the bag saying: ""Don't ask me to check, I will check on my own"". To his surprise, he could not find anything except a pair of goggles, he started talking even more rudely and threatened to keep me in an inspection room. Then he asked me to make some adjustment to the bag even after I told him that I had an injury in both of my hands.

Hyderabad,"✅ Verified Review | Due to more domestic flights serving the airport than international flights, the queue to the baggage checks at the domestic section of the departure hall is very long. It took me about 30 minutes to get my baggage checked by the machines because of the queue. Therefore I can imagine queue at the Immigration counter for outbound international flights will be longer. The passenger terminal building looks smaller than Changi Airport Terminal 1 and passengers are not allowed to access to the airport offices of airlines unfortunately. One has to engage the Information counter staff's help to call the relevant airline office staff to arrange a meeting and therefore almost impossible to get any airline travel brochure. One can only buy tickets through the windows of the ticketing offices of the airlines next to the entrance of the building. The Plaza Premium Lounge after the Immigration serves healthy Indian food and it is the most attractive place of the airport to be in. There is the airport transit hotel in the basement managed by the Plaza Network of lounges while the Novotel Hotel of the airport is way outside from a passenger's view at the airport, meaning one has to travel by taxi to reach the Novotel Hyderabad Airport Hotel.

The send-off party paid hundred rupees per head just to stand for more than an hour on the other side of a railing to chat with us. There was a cafeteria but no way for all of us to go there and sit. They stood for a long while and finally bid us a premature goodbye.

Hyderabad,Been through this airport a number of times and I find it the best in India. A nice landscaped and well signed access road takes you to the terminal with ample parking. The only drawback there are just 2 (1 each for domestic and international) entrance points and 2 exit points at dep and arrival levels for passengers and these get very crowded. The main terminal hall is airy well lit and smack clean. One doesnt feel congested with a good and organised number of check in counters. Very impressed to find a laptop and mobile charging kiosk in the checkin hall itself .The dep area has an array of different food joints duty free shops (overpriced) children play area small smoking room and also a prayer hall. The arrival hall is pleasant with quick immigrations except that on most occasions it takes a good while for baggage to come on the belt.

Hyderabad,New airport (Rajiv Gandhi) is out in the middle of nowhere - a good 60 minute drive from town in moderate traffic - but is definitely miles ahead of the old airport and far better than Chennai Delhi or Mumbai. The one thing you'll notice upon getting in or out of the terminal is the crowd control - you don't have to fight through the thousands of gawkers that normally congest the entry gates. The check-in area is spacious and unlike other airports in India you don't have to get your bags pre-screened before going to the check-in counter. Security check is a breeze and there is a better selection of shops and restaurants than the old airport (albeit badly overpriced). The terminal building itself is clean airy and bright with adequate seating at the gate areas and has clean modern bathroom facilities. The negatives - the distance from the city the exorbitant parking fees (300 rupees just for your driver to wait for you) high prices for food and drinks in the terminal and the bags take a good while to get to the carousels.

Hyderabad,Efficient? Not in my experience. Arrival is painful: the immigration officers take about ten minutes for each Indian passengers (foreigners are faster but are few and far between) so unless you are among the first off the 'plane you will have a very long wait. Then you have to wait for checked baggage -- the screening procedure means that two hours can easily pass between touchdown and your bag arriving. Departures: note that once you have checked in you cannot leave the departure area and so are at the mercy of the limited and over-priced catering that the airport offers. Check-in was slow and inefficient with staff who couldn't be bothered to handle requests for exit row seats etc. There is a cyber-cafe in the departure lounge but its computers have loads of pop-ups and probably spyware as well so not a good place to do your on- line banking.,4.0,0,Unknown,Unknown,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Unknown,efficient experience arrival painful immigration officers take ten minutes indian passengers foreigners faster far unless among first plane long wait wait checked baggage screening procedure means two hours easily pass touchdown bag arriving departures note checked leave departure area mercy limited overpriced catering airport offers checkin slow inefficient staff couldnt bothered handle requests exit row seats etc cybercafe departure lounge computers loads popups probably spyware well good place line banking,0.8254,Positive,Indian
Hyderabad,Small and efficient airport somewhat slow staff and nothing remarkable. Arrival and Departure lounges are separated Arrivals on the ground floor and Departures on the first floor accessible to vehicles by a ramp so picking someone up or dropping some one is quite easy. Parking fees have gone up sharply to Rs.50 / hour so watch out. Inside the terminal its like any other airport in India designed in a cramped way and not maintained very well. TV screens that are supposed to show flight arrivals and departures show too much advertising and are not very easy to read. Check in and security procedures are quick but passport control can take a long time if there is insufficient staff when you pass through. Police officers and other staff are friendly and alert. The departure waiting area can comfortably hold passengers for 2 planes the only small coffee shop starts with Rs.30 for a coffee ! There are 3 airbridges which have been in use every time I passed through this airport so boarding and deplaning are quite quick. For passengers arriving from domestic flights baggage claim is quite fast. For international arrivals all baggage is first screened by customs to identify any goods that attract tax. This happens out of your vision so be patient until the luggage is screened and put on the conveyor belt. If you see a big white cross made with chalk on your luggage it means the screening officer inside thinks you have something to declare and the customs officers at the exit will catch you if you pretend otherwise. Once out of customs before getting out of the airport locate and use the prepaid Auto and Taxi counters to pay your fare first get a voucher and take the Auto / Taxi whose vehicle number is indicated on the voucher.
