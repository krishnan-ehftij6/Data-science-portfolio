# **Predicting Customer Behavior**  

## **Business Problem**  
This project aims to predict customer behavior based on choices made during the booking process and determine whether they successfully completed the booking.  

A dataset was provided, and the following steps were taken to solve the problem:

## **Project Workflow**  

### ✅ **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyzed the dataset to identify key features and patterns  
- Checked for missing values and performed necessary data cleaning  

### 📊 **2. Visualization**  
- Created visualizations to understand the distribution of bookings  
- Identified patterns in customer choices affecting booking completion  

### 🏗 **3. Data Preparation**  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Scaled numerical features  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  

### 🌳 **4. Model Deployment**  
- Implemented a **tree-based model** (Random Forest) to predict booking completion  
- Trained the model using processed data  

### 📈 **5. Model Evaluation**  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Generated visualizations to identify key factors influencing customer booking behavior  

### 📑 **6. Presentation**  
- Summarized key insights and findings in a presentation slide deck
